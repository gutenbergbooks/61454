<h2 id="hdr_1">A LITTLE EASY MONEY</h2>
</div>

<p>A great many years ago, when Tom Byrnes was the
able and efficient chief of the detective force of New
York, a certain class of women, very much in evidence
around the hotels and resorts, were known, from the
peculiar manner of their work, as Badger Molls.</p>

<p>There was one in particular who had added a spectacular
dance to her many other accomplishments and
which helped her not a little in meeting the right kind
of people.</p>

<p>To be a Badger Moll a woman had to have nerve,
assurance, a fair amount of good looks, be able to read
character and keep her wits about her at all times.
There were occasions when she was up against it so
good and strong that it didn’t seem as if there was
one chance in a hundred for her to do her part of the
trick, but in ninety times out of a hundred she landed
the bundle of the victim.</p>

<p>That is to say, of course, with the aid of her confederate.</p>

<p>The old days of the Moll have gone by, but the new
days have come and they are here now. The new
representative is of a higher class, of a superior education,
is more adept, and, as a rule, gets more money.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that during the past ten years
only two big jobs have fallen through—that is, so far
as is known—and these things usually become known
when they are brought to the notice of the police.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
A handsomely gowned woman, with a bearing that
would deceive almost anyone, comes down the line.
She looks like my lady from Fifth avenue, but if you
will notice her eyes you will see in them the look of a
huntress.</p>

<p>She is on the trail of men, and it is a rare thing for
her to make a mistake. Mistakes in her business, you
know, sometimes spell Sing Sing, as a lady by the
name of Moore will tell you if you ever meet her and
she should become confidential.</p>

<p>As she passes the hotels you will notice this particular
woman hesitates in her stride, she goes into the low
gear and she looks questioningly at the men who are
standing about.</p>

<p>It is the glance of an expert, but it is cleverly veiled.</p>

<p>Even though you and I know her and know what
her business is, we are attracted by her to a certain extent,
just as people are attracted by a magnificent
tigress or leopard in the menagerie. They have fangs
and claws, but they are hidden, and being concealed
are forgotten for the time.</p>

<p>This is a human tigress, but she is not on the scent
of blood, she’s trailing bank rolls.</p>

<p>There is, however, nothing unusual in that, when
you come to think of it, because that is what four-fifths
of the world is doing, and the other fifth is being
chased and knows it.</p>

<p>The tigress throws in her high speed and passes on
until she has reached the entrance to another hotel,
and here the scent of prey comes strongly to her nostrils.</p>

<p>A fine-looking man of about fifty years is leaning
carelessly against one of the marble columns. He has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
dined well, anyone can see that, and he is half way into
his after-dinner cigar. He is in the ripe stage; the
time to ask a favor, or to have a courtesy extended.
He is at peace with himself and everybody else, and as
the tigress passes by he gets a flash of those black eyes
which tell him a story that while it is not new, is always
interesting, especially under these circumstances,
when he is a thousand miles from home.</p>

<p>There are few men, anyhow, who can stand temptation
when they are strangers in a strange city. Man is
a companionable sort of a proposition and to be at his
best must have society.</p>

<p>This one, who is perhaps the father of an interesting
family, and who is above reproach in his native city,
and who would become indignant at the thought of a
street flirtation, involuntarily straightens himself up,
and taking a firmer hold of his cigar, glances after the
slowly retreating figure of the lady with the black
eyes.</p>

<p>It’s a trim shape, by Jove; and look at that ankle.</p>

<p>A peach.</p>

<p>“Nothing common about her,” he soliloquizes. “Just
a nice girl, perhaps, who is a bit lonely, too.”</p>

<p>And then, at that particular moment, the “nice girl,”
who has been sauntering very slowly, turns around and
looking directly at him, smiles.</p>

<p>A woman’s smile.</p>

<p>Cast off your lines, my boy, and on your way, for the
magnetism of that smile has you lashed to the mast,
but you don’t know it yet. What you have in your
mind is that you’ll just take a little walk and have a
little talk, just to fill in a few lonely hours, you know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
So he leaves the mooring of his hotel and trails the
trailer.</p>

<p>One short block he walks, and then just as he is
about to come abreast of her she turns about and meets
him with the same smile that has been doing duty
for the past five years.</p>

<p>She knew he had reached that particular spot by that
woman’s intuition, keyed up so fine as to be on feather
edge all the time.</p>

<p>Her little bow is modest—even coy. It is like the
bow of a school girl who is afraid she is not doing
quite the right thing, but who is just a trifle reckless,
and is willing to take a chance or two just for a lark.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” she asks.</p>

<p>“Great; how are you; fine night; where are you
going?” he rattles off, trying to appear at ease, and be
the real fellow.</p>

<p>“I was just taking a walk. You see, it was so quiet
in the house, and I sat there all alone until I just
thought I would die, so I came out to get a little fresh
air and see if I couldn’t walk myself tired before bed
time.”</p>

<p>That accounts for her being out, of course, and it is
very nicely delivered, too; besides, it gives the man a
chance to say something, and he is prompt to say it.</p>

<p>“All alone? You don’t mean to say that you live
all alone?”</p>

<p>Oh, no; she doesn’t live all alone all the time. But
Jack—that’s her husband, you know—he is on the
road—commercial man, you see, the best and dearest
fellow in all the world, and it’s such a horrid position
he has, too, always traveling. He went away just a
month ago on his Western trip, to be gone two months,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
think of it; almost an age. He’s with the big dry
goods house of Wools &amp; Muslins, the biggest in New
York. But next year Jack is going to have an office
position and then everything will be all right.</p>

<p>“After that,” she goes on, “Jack and the baby and I
will be quite happy.”</p>

<p>“The baby? Have you a baby?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course.”</p>

<p>“And you say you are lonely? I should think that
the baby would——”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course, so it would, but don’t you see, Jack’s
mother, who lives with us, went to visit some friends
in the country—Montclair, do you know where that is?—and
she thought it would do the little fellow good
and she took him along, and now I am so sorry I let
him go.”</p>

<p>Isn’t it too beautiful for anything, and isn’t she an
artist of whom Jack ought to be very proud?</p>

<p>“Well, I am a little lonely myself,” says the business
man from Dayton, O., “and I think you and I ought to
cheer one another up. What do you think about that
proposition?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know. It’s very nice to have you talk
to me, but I feel a little bit frightened about it all. You
know I never spoke to a strange man on the street before
like this, and I am sure that Jack wouldn’t like it
if——”</p>

<p>“Yes, but Jack isn’t here now. Who knows what he
is doing? You know these traveling men when they
get away from home and home ties have been known
to——”</p>

<p>“Yes, but not my Jack. You don’t know him. He
would never do anything wrong, for he told me so.”</p>

  <div class="caption">A spectacular dance which helped her in meeting people</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
And now they have walked four blocks.</p>

<p>There is a hack driver and his wagon at the corner.</p>

<p>“Cab, sir; have a cab?”</p>

<p>He’s on, and immediately takes the tip offered him.</p>

<p>“Suppose we take a little drive through the Park,”
suggests the man.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it would be quite right. I would like
to, but——Oh, if we were only real well acquainted,
I would like to, but you see——”</p>

<p>The end of it is that the cab drive is vetoed, and he
begins to think as to how he can best entertain her in
some other way. He takes a hasty sidelong glance at
her, and his heart increases about ten beats to the minute.
She’s all right, you bet. Why, he wouldn’t mind
staying in New York another week <span class="locked">if——</span></p>

<p>“Let’s go somewhere and have a nice bottle of
wine,” he says.</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t mean to offend me, but you
shouldn’t ask me anything like that. I think I am doing
very wrong in even talking to you, but I can’t help
it. There was something about you when I passed by
that seemed to attract me. I have done something to-night
that I have never been guilty of before, and
never will be again. I don’t object to wine, because we
have it in the house, but I didn’t think you would ask
me to go to a common saloon with you—a place I have
never been in in my life. But I suppose I deserve it
for speaking to you the way I did, and for walking
with you the way I am now.”</p>

<p>He protests, he apologizes, and he feels that he has
made a great mistake. He is humiliated beyond expression.
Here is a nice little woman with a husband
and a baby, who has permitted him to accost her on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
the street, probably because she felt that she needed
some human companionship, and he has insulted her
by asking her to go to a public place and drink a bottle
of wine with him, just as if she were a woman of the
streets. He feels that he cannot do enough to make
amends to her.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe,” she says, sweetly, “that you intended
to hurt my feelings for a moment. Let you and
I be simply good friends. We are both a little lonesome;
let us spend a pleasant evening together, for it
isn’t likely that we will ever meet again after to-night.
We will act as if we were brother and sister; but if you
would really like a bottle of wine I have a lot home
that Jack says is pretty good, and we can go there and
be all by ourselves.”</p>

<p>But a moment later she repents and says it will not
do at all, for suppose any of the neighbors should see
them going in, what then?</p>

<p>He clutches at the idea like a drowning man clutches
at a straw, for this is a wonderfully nice girl he has
met in this accidental way, and he would like to become
better acquainted.</p>

<p>So he begins to coax, and she laughingly refuses to
listen. He pleads, argues and promises, and then he
stops in a shop and blows himself to a five-pound box
of candy for the baby—and her.</p>

<p>When he peels the bill off a roll that would choke an
elephant she sizes it all up out of the tail of her eye,
and makes a mental calculation as to how much is
there.</p>

<p>She’s just a trifle more endearing to him after that,
and it strikes him that she is getting a little reckless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
“Come on,” she says, quite gayly, and with an affectation
of sportiness, “I will take you up to the house,
but you must promise me on your word of honor that
you won’t remember the street or the number and that
you’ll never try to see me again. Remember, this is
just for one evening, and I don’t want you to think I
am anything but what I seem.”</p>

<p>“I could never think that,” he says, quite soberly.</p>

<p>“What must you think of a girl who will permit a
stranger to speak to her on the street?”</p>

<p>“I should think that in your case she would be very
nice.”</p>

<p>She is laughing and chatting just like a girl out of
school, and she has interested him so much that he
hasn’t noticed that they were getting into quieter and
darker streets, until she suddenly turns into a hallway
which is just like a thousand other New York hallways,
and announces:</p>

<p>“Here we are at last; now don’t make any noise.”</p>

<p>Up one flight, and she’s fumbling for a key, which
she finds in a moment, and then the door is opened.</p>

<p>The lights are turned low, and for some reason or
other she doesn’t turn them up, which he notes with a
certain feeling of pleasure.</p>

<p>“Now take off your hat and coat, and we will have
that bottle of wine I told you about, for I am going to
let you stay just one hour, after which I am going to
try and forgive myself for having spoken to you.”</p>

<p>It is all very nice and charming, and the wine is very
good—a bit better, in fact, than he had any idea it
would be.</p>

<p>When the bottle and the glasses are empty he finds
himself sitting beside her on a divan. His arm is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
about her waist and she is struggling to free herself.
He leans over to kiss her, but she deftly turns her face
away.</p>

<p>“You must not try to kiss me,” she whispers, but as
she speaks she throws her arms about his neck.</p>

<p>It seems to the staid old business bulwark from the
West as if he had been sitting there for hours, when
suddenly the electric bell rings.</p>

<p>Both jump to their feet.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asks in a low voice.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I can’t think,” she answers, holding
her hand to her head. “Perhaps it’s Jack. My God,
if it should be Jack. He will kill you if he finds you
here. I could never explain it. Take your hat and
coat quick. Here, this way, the back door, and run,
run as fast as you can. Don’t stop, please, until you
get to your hotel. Go, go, at once.”</p>

<p>With hat and coat in hand he finds himself pushed
out in a dark passageway. He gropes his way to the
stairs.</p>

<p>A man is coming up, a man with a traveling case.</p>

<p>It’s Jack, as sure as you live.</p>

<p>Guiltily he walks down, steps hurriedly to the street
door, passes out, and starts on a brisk trot up the street.
At the first corner he turns, then he turns another
block, then he turns again, with the instinct of a hunted
hare. So he pursued his zig-zag course for many
blocks, until he finally stops to ask directions.</p>

<p>“The Gilt-Edge Hotel? certainly; four blocks over
to the avenue then about twenty down.”</p>

<p>He walks the four blocks while he catches his
breath, and then he gets aboard a car only to find he
hasn’t a cent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
Worse; he hasn’t a watch, nor a scarf pin.</p>

<p>He must have lost them while he was running.</p>

<p>He gets off and stands on the corner to think it over.</p>

<p>Eleven hundred dollars in good money gone; a
watch worth $350 and a pin worth at least $150.</p>

<p>The faint odor of violets comes back to him, and
then he comes to his senses.</p>

<p>Stung.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>“It took you a long while to ring that bell, Billy,
after I gave you the tip. Don’t wait so long next time.
You must be getting old, for you’re working very slow
lately.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t hear the buzzer at first; I don’t think you
pressed it hard enough. I’ll give it a look to-morrow
and see. But I would never have sized that old guy up
for eleven hundred.”</p>

<p>“You never can tell what they’ve got until you take
it away from them.”</p>

<h2 id="hdr_2">CASTING AN OLD SHOE</h2>
</div>

<p>It may be that you—whoever you are or wherever
you are—don’t know what it means to go “down the
line.” But in New York—in order that we may start
right—“The Line” means that part of Broadway where
at night the lights burn brightest, and where the mob—swell
and otherwise—move back and forth like the
ebb and flow of the tide—hunting, hunting, ever on
the hunt.</p>

<p>From Twenty-third street to Forty-second, and back
again, and you have gone down The Line. Sometimes
it costs you nothing for this innocent little amusement;
this feast of the eyes; and then again it is liable to cost
you a great deal.</p>

<p>It all depends upon who you are, and what you are
and how easy you are.</p>

<p>And there you are.</p>

<p>I once knew a man, and this is pat while I am on
this subject, who came to New York from Buffalo. He
was only going to remain for a day or so, and then he
was going to hike himself back to his home by the big
lake.</p>

<p>He had sold out his business, and when he landed in
New York he had a bank roll of twenty-one thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>It was enough to make any ordinary man round
shouldered, but he was a husky guy who was used to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
the long green, and it didn’t bother him any more than
if it had been beef-and-bean money.</p>

<p>He put up at a big swell hotel, and during the evening,
when time hung a bit heavy on his hands, he got
it into his head that he would take a walk down the
line, and then turn in among the feathers.</p>

<p>With a perfecto between his teeth, he got as far as
Thirty-eighth street, where he met his finish.</p>

<p>When he arrived at his hotel at ten o’clock the next
morning he asked the proprietor to loan him twenty
dollars to get home.</p>

<p>No explanations go with this, because he was sport
enough never to tell how it happened. It doesn’t even
point a moral, for there are no morals on the line.</p>

<p>Going down the street, like a yacht under full sail, is
a woman whom it cost not a cent less than $750 to put
in commission. In the male vernacular she is what
might be termed a peach, and there is no need to translate
that for you, for the simple reason that you are
familiar enough with the different kinds of fruit to
know what that means.</p>

<p>Because of her figure and the fact that she was a
good fellow she was an attraction at the beach.</p>

<p>She has a history, of course. They all have, to a
certain extent, but this is somewhat out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>In her day—and her day wasn’t so many years ago—she
was a noted beauty, and she had one of the most
charming apartments in New York. It was frequented
by what might be termed the high-class sporting crowd—lawyers
with national reputations, actors whose
names were in big type on the billboards, business men
who posed as the bulwarks of the commercial world,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
and politicians who waxed sleek and fat at the public
cribs. They played poker there and were entertained
royally by her. She gave the choicest of dinners and
served the best of wines, and she was a perfect hostess.
Her rooms were more like a club than anything else,
and she was never annoyed by any love-making on
the part of her guests, for a very good, substantial and
simple reason—the man who paid the shot and who
figured as the real one in that charmed and exclusive
circle was none other than a high official of New
York.</p>

<p>His hospitality, dispensed through her, was almost
boundless, and there are those who say that there was
method in that gathering, and that many a serious
public question was discussed within the confines of
those gorgeously upholstered rooms.</p>

<p>Give a man the proper seat at the right kind of a
table, beside a woman who is beautiful, charming and
magnetic, serve him with a perfect dinner, with good
wine selected by a connoisseur, then after the dessert
provide him with a cigar which cannot be bought in
the open market, and it is almost a sure thing that, if
you have any proposition to make, your battle is half
won. What an ideal spot for lawyers, politicians and
capitalists to discuss things that it wouldn’t do to
have the public know.</p>

<p>And as the months rolled by this woman came to be
known by the majority of prominent men of New
York.</p>

<p>Now you can get a good look at her as she stops to
glance in that window.</p>

<p>Not to have been her guest was to have missed a lot
in life, and when you lost to her in a little poker game<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
you were almost sorry your losses were not heavier.</p>

<p>She had more diamond rings than she could wear at
any one time, and she had the best wardrobe in town.
No matter what she saw and wanted it was hers. She
scarcely needed to ask for it—she just wished, and it
came as though she had been blessed with some fairy
godmother who waved a magic wand, and brought
things on the wind.</p>

<p>So there’s the picture, painted in the most ordinary
colors, and there’s the woman, who grew to think the
world was made for her to play with and do with as
she liked.</p>

<p>When she was at the height of her career, this lawyer-political
friend of hers—this champion and provider—really
and truly fell in love. He was well past
middle age, but that made no difference. After many
years of waiting—years which were punctuated with
numerous affairs which he thought spelled love—he
found the girl at last in the daughter of a man whose
position left him nothing to wish for. She was a society
girl and charming enough for any man.</p>

<p>Before he fully realized what he was doing he had
proposed marriage to her and had been accepted without
giving that other one a thought.</p>

<p>When he understood that he had to break with her,
he knew that he had the job of his life in front of him,
but he was game enough to go at it without a moment’s
hesitancy, and so one night, after the crowd had gone
and the last poker chip cashed in, he told her the
story.</p>

<p>“I am going to marry and settle down,” he said.
“My position demands it, and I cannot go on living
this way forever. I feel that I have a political future,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
and I must protect myself. If I ever came up again
for any prominent office, as I expect to in the near
future, my relations with you would mean the worst
kind of defeat for me. I want to be fair with you, and
I am willing to settle any claim you may have on me
for anything within reason.”</p>

<p>His story took a long while in the telling, and
through it all she never moved nor spoke.</p>

<p>When he had quite finished she stretched and
yawned.</p>

<p>“Is that all you have to say?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, “that is all, except that I hope
we will part friends, and that if ever I can do anything
for you, I——”</p>

<p>“Now whatever you do,” she spoke up sharply,
“don’t get tiresome nor sentimental. You’re a good
fellow, and always have been—so you think. I have
come into your life and have answered your purpose.
I have entertained your friends and made it pleasant
for you and them. I suppose you think I did it simply
because I was provided for and had everything I
wanted—that I was a sort of a high-class servant who
was satisfied with her wages. If I had been wise I
would have anticipated this and been prepared for it.
I would have had enough money in the bank to have
been independent to a certain extent. I am like a
poker chip—you bought me, played with me, and now
you are ready to cash me in because you have finished
with me. You are a good fellow—with the men—but
you are very tiresome and that reminds me that I am
tired and wish you would run along. Go home now,
and dream of the nice girl you are going to marry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
He stood looking at her like a man under the influence
of a drug. He did not know what to say. He
had expected a scene of some kind, and he was disappointed.
His vanity was touched. Why, here was a
woman for whom he had done everything in the world,
and whom he thought loved him, and she was parting
from him without a tear or even so much as a word of
expostulation. That didn’t suit him at all. He wanted
her to throw her arms about his neck and beg him not
to go. Of course, he would have gone just the same,
but he didn’t want to think that she would let him go
so easily.</p>

<p>The pride and vanity of man is a peculiar thing, and
there are not ten men in a thousand who understand
women, even though they think they do. This man,
clever, handsome and brilliant, was of the majority
who do not know, and he had nothing to say to the
woman who had entertained him and with whom he
had spent many pleasant hours.</p>

<p>He looked at her for a moment and then he went
out as though he had been whipped from the door.</p>

<p>She turned the key in the lock and then gave way to
her real feelings by crying as only a heart-broken
woman can.</p>

<p>He had incriminated himself with her to such an extent
that he dreaded her. She had been too calm to
suit him, and he feared trouble to come. He had no
definite idea as to what form it might take, but he
wanted to avoid it.</p>

<p>So he went direct to one of his most astute legal
friends—the same one, who, by the way, told me the
whole story in a burst of half-drunken confidence—and
they sat up half the night figuring on how to head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
her off in case she attempted to do anything that would
reflect on his “spotless” character. How careful the
man is of his name as a rule, and how despicably he can
treat a woman when it suits either his mood or convenience.</p>

<p>That midnight conference finally resolved itself into
definite shape by the counsellor saying:</p>

<p>“I’ll take $10,000 to her and get everything she has
of yours and her signature under a statement that will
leave you free and clear.”</p>

<p>And so it was agreed.</p>

<p>Lawyers do not act very quickly unless their own interests
are at stake. Speed was required here and the
action was fast enough for anyone. The next day, at
noon, the lawyer, who knew her well enough to call
her by her first name, called upon her, and as he was
ushered into the handsome apartment he involuntarily
put his hand to his breast pocket, which contained ten
new, crisp one thousand dollar bills—the price of her
silence, from his standpoint.</p>

<p>It is interesting to be able to note that the interview
was short, sharp, sweet and to the point. He made his
eloquent speech of how his friend, who had always
loved her devotedly, was forced by something which
she could not understand to break from her and marry
a woman whose position in society was assured. He
was prepared to pay her an amount of money—quite a
liberal one, in fact—so that she should want for nothing.
All he desired was a certain package of letters
and a statement that she had only known his friend
in the most casual way.</p>

<p>“How much are you going to pay me?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
“Ten thousand dollars, and here it is,” he said, producing
the bills.</p>

<p>“I will do what he wants,” was all she said, and in
ten minutes the job was done.</p>

<p>Then he laid the money on the table.</p>

<p>“What is your fee?” She spoke very softly.</p>

<p>“My fee?” he repeated, as if he did not quite catch
her meaning.</p>

<p>“Yes, your fee. How much are you charging this
friend of yours for what you are doing for him?”</p>

<p>“I am doing it through friendship. There is no such
thing as fee in a case like this.”</p>

<p>“You have earned this money, and I do not want it,”
she went on. “I am not a blackmailer nor can my
promise of immunity be bought. I, too, understand
what the word friendship means, and I am not so degraded
nor lost but that I can take advantage of it.
It is such men as you and he that make such women as
I am. Good-day.”</p>

<p>He was in the hall with the money in his hand before
he quite realized how it all happened.</p>

<p>Between you and me, my friends, I would sooner
have her conscience than the conscience of the very fine
gentleman whose public career has since been marked
by repeated triumphs.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_3">THE LONG WAY ’ROUND</h2>
</div>

<p>The Girl from Philadelphia wasn’t a beauty by any
means, but she had a nice fetching way, good teeth,
and a cheerful, contagious laugh which are three
things that have beauty left at the post. Beauty, you
see, is only good for a short sprint at the best, and in
a long race is liable to lag a bit toward the finish, but
the other propositions are stayers nine times out of
ten and generally manage to come under the wire in
good shape.</p>

<p>Thirty days in the big city, if spent in the right kind
of company, usually mean about a year in Quakertown,
and force of circumstances had thrown The Girl
in pretty close contact with high-flyers. You see, it
all came about this way:</p>

<p>She had been playing the soubrette part in some
amateur theatricals, and everybody who saw her—except
some girl friends who wanted to be soubrettes,
too—said she was the real thing and that she had Della
Fox in her palmy days beaten the length of Chestnut
street, and as for Millie James, why there was nothing
to it.</p>

<p>That started the theatrical bee buzzing in her conning-tower,
so she immediately formed the habit of
reading the theatrical papers instead of the society
notes, and she got the matinee habit so bad that she
didn’t miss one show a month. Before that her fad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
had been gymnastics and she was the real thing on
physical culture.</p>

<div id="illo_4" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img src="images/i_028.jpg" width="433" height="619" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">She was once the real thing on physical culture</div></div>

<p>Now when a girl gets that way she needs either a
husband and honeymoon to distract her attention or
a hard-faced guardian—female, of course—to follow
her wherever she goes.</p>

<p>So in view of the fact that this girl had neither, she
studied the play bills and did pretty much as she liked.
She was just ripe to sign with a traveling show or
listen to the argument of any actor man who offered
her the bait of a chance to do a stunt behind the footlights.
She lived the way a soubrette ought to live—at
least, she thought she did. In a locked drawer in
her dressing case she kept a box of make-up, and when
the rest of the family had retired she fixed her face
up so she looked like a comic valentine. She figured
upon this as a sort of preliminary training in case she
should ever get a chance to break into the business;
look like a twenty-dollar gold piece to the public, and
feel like a plugged nickel when she was in her dollar-a-day
room after the show. She might have been
dreaming yet if a young fellow who once suped for
Mansfield hadn’t made her acquaintance. He called on
her at her home, and they hadn’t been talking twenty
minutes when she sprung the soubrette business, and
told him that some day she hoped to get on the professional
stage.</p>

<p>“The only way to get a chance is to go to New
York,” he said. “There’s where all the good shows
start from, as well as a good many of the bad ones,
and if a girl has talent, an agent or a manager will
grab her just the same as a hobo will grab a ham sandwich,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
no matter what his nationality is. Why, I once
knew a girl who went there from Forked River, New
Jersey. She didn’t know anything, but she had ginger,
and she’s been on the road for two seasons with the
Bon Ton Burlesquers. What do you think of that?
Philadelphia’s all right in a way, but I’ll bet if Maude
Adams had been born here she’d be behind the ribbon
counter in some big dry goods store instead of the
swellest little actress that ever took a bunch of roses
over the footlights.”</p>

<p>That is what started the trouble, and that night
when The Girl went up to her room she packed a dress-suit
case, putting in her grease paints first, of course,
and then she penned a neat little note of farewell forever
to her parents, after which she waited until the
house was quiet and then slipped out as quietly as a
burglar. She had enough money to make the breakaway
and keep her about thirty days, by the end of
which time she figured she would have a job at about
fifty per week, with traveling expenses and Pullman
car paid by the manager.</p>

<p>She had a roseate view of life, and she thought that
as soon as she hit the big burg the managers would be
falling over each other trying to get her to sign a contract.
She didn’t know that making a hit in a little
show given by the Golden Rod Society for the Supplying
of Vegetables to the Cannibal Tribes of Africa was
quite a different thing to going on the professional
stage, and she imagined if she could do well in the part
of <i>Betsey, the Romp</i>, in “Who Killed Cock Robin,” she
could do equally well on the stage of any big theatre.</p>

<p>She had as much hope as a piece of Swiss cheese has
holes when she climbed aboard the sleeping car which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
was scheduled to leave for New York at 1 A. M., but
when she landed in the cold, gray dawn a good part of
it had gone and had left her a trifle weak in the knees,
which, by the way, is a decided symptom of weakness.</p>

<p>It took her just two hours to find a boarding house,
and until the next day to get her nerve back. It was
only because of her youth that it came back at all.
She got a list of the names of managers and started
out to do business, but no one seemed to want any
amateur soubrettes from Philadelphia. By two o’clock
there was nothing that looked like a job, but she had
received eleven invitations to go out to lunch from
eleven different genials who didn’t seem to want to talk
business; who were inclined to be affectionate and
who called her “My Dear” in every other sentence.</p>

<p>That night she went to a vaudeville show, and she
was so impressed with the ease with which the turns
were pulled off that she concluded she would do an act
of her own. That is how it happened that the day
after she forsook the legitimate for the variety, and
knocked at the office doors of a different species of
managers. Very busy fellows these were, too, and
she got her dismissal in almost every case with startling
rapidity.</p>

<p>Here is a sample of the dialogue:</p>

<p>“Where have you worked before?”</p>

<p>“I have never been on the professional stage, but I
played the part of a soubrette in amateur shows in
Philadelphia, and all my friends told me that——”</p>

<p>“But have you an act of your own?”</p>

<p>“No, not yet, but——”</p>

<p>“Well, you frame up some kind of an act, then come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
around and see me, and I may be able to get you a
trial somewhere.”</p>

<p>And then twenty-three.</p>

<p>Many a good fighter has quit when he found every
rush he made was stopped with a tantalizing jab in the
nose, and many a man has thrown up the sponge when
he has walked the streets day in and day out and discovered
that nobody wanted him.</p>

<p>At the end of a week The Girl would have written a
letter home or taken a train back if it had not been for
her pride. She didn’t want to acknowledge defeat, but
she was on the verge of it.</p>

<p>She was coming out of a theatre one night when she
met The Man.</p>

<p>There must be a man else there would be no story.
He was about forty-five years old, had been through
enough campaigns to give him self-possession, and he
had been successful enough to be egotistic. Two minutes
later they were walking down Broadway together,
and she was rather glad that she had found someone
who took an interest in her. One-half hour after that
and they were seated at a table in a big restaurant; the
order had been given and she was telling him all about
herself while he was looking her over with an exceedingly
critical eye and making up his mind that she
showed up rather good under a strong light, especially
when she smiled.</p>

<p>A broiled lobster, a quart of claret, then a couple of
birds and a quart of wine are enough to change the
ideas and opinions of a lot of people, especially if such
a bill of fare is unusual, and so it happened that when
the red began to come to The Girl’s cheeks, the things
The Man were saying to her didn’t seem so much out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
of the way after all. Besides, that hall bedroom in the
musty old boarding house was rapidly becoming a
nightmare. Between you and me, if she had never
smiled this thing would never have happened.</p>

<p>The Man lighted a cigar, and as he blew the first
puff of blue smoke toward the ceiling he observed:</p>

<p>“My dear, marriage is nothing more nor less than a
useless and barbaric rite, and when it is all summed up
it amounts to nothing in the end. Why should you be
legally bound to any man in this world? It would be
all right as long as you loved him, then you wouldn’t
care, but suppose your feelings changed, what then?
In order to get a divorce from him you would have to
catch him committing a crime for which the law would
grant you a divorce, or get good evidence, which
amounts to the same thing. You might separate from
him if he was cruel to you or didn’t support you, but
suppose he was kind and gave you all the money you
wanted, then you would still have to live with him as
his wife. Now, on the other hand, if you were not
married to him, you would have a perfect right, as
soon as your feelings changed, to leave him without a
moment’s notice. You would be under no obligations
to him under any circumstances, and he, knowing that
you were free to go and come as you pleased, would, in
order to keep you, treat you with greater consideration
than if you were his wife. You can believe me or not,
just as you wish, but an understanding between a man
and a woman is all that is necessary to happiness in
this world. Don’t be old-fashioned, but let us make an
agreement of some kind between ourselves. You will
be perfectly independent, free to go and come as you
like, and do as you wish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
There was a certain amount of logic in this argument,
especially when the reverse of the picture is a
cheap room in a cheap boarding house. So the end
of the first chapter was that the landlady wondered
why her lodger never came back, even to get her case
and the few belongings it contained. It was all mysterious
to her, but as she was paid in advance, she
said nothing, and at the end of the week rented the
room to an old fellow with asthma who was living on
an allowance.</p>

<p>So far as the stage was concerned, that bright bubble
had burst, and instead of haunting the offices of
managers, The Girl took to breakfasting at 10, lunching
at 2 and dining at 8. The theatres to her were
merely places of amusement—good to fill in time which
could be used in no other way, and her ambition to
shine as a footlight favorite went when she found
that she could live without being annoyed by any of the
responsibilities of life. She gradually grew to know
that the name of The Man was a very familiar one in
the big cities and at times the newspapers printed his
picture. She had assumed that name—it was in the
compact, although there were few who knew it. Several
times, when he called on her, he brought some
of his friends to dinner, but these occasions were not
frequent, by any means, and she knew she wasn’t a
part of his intimate life.</p>

<p>Now see how time makes puppets of both men and
women, for this story has one merit in that it is true.</p>

<p>The Man took sick in Chicago, and the first she
knew of it was when she read it in the newspapers.
Every stage of his disease was chronicled until he died,
and when she read that the paper dropped from her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
hands and she felt again that weakness of the knees
which took her on that first morning in New York.
For four days she lived in a dream, vaguely wondering
what was to become of her, and then a brisk, alert,
dapper little man—a lawyer—called. There was nothing
sentimental about him. He was business from the
drop of the hat.</p>

<p>“I represent the family of The Man,” he announced,
abruptly. “There is a codicil in his will which bequeaths
you $250,000. Of course, we can break that
and not half try, but the widow and children don’t
want any unpleasant notoriety, and they are willing to
settle for $50,000, which I can pay to you at once. You
will accept, if you are wise, for $50,000 is a nice little
sum and it will leave you free and clear to do as you
please and will dispose of a very unpleasant situation.”</p>

<p>The death of The Man had given her a shock from
which she hadn’t yet recovered, and she asked for time
to think.</p>

<p>“Come to-morrow or the day after,” she said, “and I
will talk to you. I can’t think now.”</p>

<p>He wanted to finish it up at once, but every time she
gave him the same answer, so there was nothing for
him to do but to go.</p>

<p>And then that night there came another lawyer, one
whom she had known because The Man had brought
him on one of his visits. His argument was different:</p>

<p>“There is $250,000 coming to you; get it. It is a
clean-cut, legal will and they can’t break it, besides
there is enough there for everybody and to spare. Let
me manage it for you and don’t worry. If they want
to contest let them go ahead and I’ll beat them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
And because he said “Don’t worry; leave it all to
me,” she consented. That was the woman of it.</p>

<p>They did fight, and the newspapers printed columns
about it, for it was a great story, but they didn’t print
the part I am telling here, for that they didn’t know.
With the articles appeared her portraits, and she became
as well known as The Man had been, in a way.</p>

<p>Before the finish had been reached the heirs concluded
there had better be a settlement, and so, rather
than stand the delay of appeals in case she won, which
it was reasonably sure she would do, she accepted
$150,000 in cash.</p>

<p>The next day her maid brought her a card. It read:</p>

<p class="p1 b1 center">
“<span class="smcap">Alfred D. Cohen</span>,<br />
<span class="in6">Theatrical Promoter.”</span>
</p>

<p>“I’ll see him,” she said.</p>

<p>She had learned a thing or two since she had left
Philadelphia, so she knew what was coming and was
prepared for it when the polite, suave Mr. Cohen
walked into the room.</p>

<p>“I have come,” he said, by way of introduction, “to
make you an offer to go on the stage.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” she queried, calmly.</p>

<p>“All you will have to do is to sing two or three songs
twice a day—once in the afternoon and once in the
evening—and I am authorized to offer you $750 a
week.”</p>

<p>“And suppose I can’t sing?” she said, smiling, thinking
of the last time she had talked with a manager.</p>

<p>“That would make no difference; we would have
you coached and can give you ten weeks straight.” He
fumbled at his coat nervously, for she was really an
important personage now. “I have the contracts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
here.” He produced them and handed them over. She
read them over carefully, debated mentally as to the
policy of signing at once or waiting until another day,
finally decided on the side of deliberation, and then
said:</p>

<p>“Come and see me to-morrow at 2 and I will let you
know then.”</p>

<p>He knew intuitively she would accept, so he bowed
himself out without further argument.</p>

<p>So that is how she at last went on the stage, and if
your memory serves you well enough to take you back
a year or so you will know that she made a hit as the
singer of songs of long ago.</p>

<p>P. S.—She told her folks in Philadelphia that she
had been studying voice culture all the time.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_4">THE QUEEN OF CHINATOWN</h2>
</div>

<p>If you don’t think there are any interesting tales in
the Tenderloin, just go there some night and look
around. You don’t have to look long before you will
find something that is worth going a distance for.</p>

<p>You’ll find tragedy and pathos as close together as
the meat is to the bread in a ham sandwich, and it
doesn’t take a Sherlock Holmes to discover it, either.</p>

<p>I know a few things about the Bowery and the
Tenderloin, and for the past twenty years I have
roamed about New York by night, simply because I
was fascinated by the life after dark. Of course, you
know that this night owl business is a disease, and
when once you get it, and get it good, it is one of the
hardest things in the world to cure. In my day I have
seen many a nice, straightforward young fellow go to
the bad simply because he got the night habit.</p>

<p>It isn’t much of a combination that gets you, either,
for it’s the white lights, the music, the women and the
drinks, not counting the good fellowship, or what
passes for good fellowship, on the side.</p>

<p>The lid is on in New York to a certain extent, that
I’ll admit, but I’m going to take you under the lid.</p>

<p>It’s all a bluff, anyhow, and things go on the same as
they have been going for years, with very little change.</p>

<p>The same kind of girls are roaming the streets, the
same kind of booze is being served on the little round
tables in stuffy back rooms, and the same class of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
waiters are making short change whenever the mark
looks easy. There may be a new police captain in the
district or the precinct, but there are some things in
this world that can’t be held down any more than a
man can hold down a charge of dynamite after the cap
has been exploded.</p>

<p>Talk about your high pressure life—that’s it. Ten
years is the limit for the careful ones, and I’ve seen
them go off in five. Why, only the other day a hospital
ambulance backed up to a downtown tenement, and
when it went away it carried a woman whose lease
of life had about expired.</p>

<p>There was a crowd which gathered, as usual—men,
women and children, all filled with a morbid curiosity,
which makes people flock and gaze with interest at
anything which approaches a bit of human wreckage,
and of them all there was not more than one or two
who knew that the sick woman had once been known
as the Queen of Chinatown, and had been made the
subject of many an interesting story.</p>

<p>It seems only a few years ago that they called her
the Queen, and you wondered why until you looked
at her and heard her talk.</p>

<p>Then you knew.</p>

<p>She was more than good looking, and what was just
a bit rarer, she was educated. There was about her a
certain amount of refinement which forced itself to the
surface like a life preserver under water, every once in
a while, but which as the years rolled on gradually disappeared,
just like any other veneer. If the constant
dropping of water will wear away a stone, in just so
sure a way will environment contaminate, and human
nature seek the lower level.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
So here is the picture:</p>

<p>This so-called Queen, coming into Chinatown—by
what route only she can tell—and creating a mild sensation
among the Orientals who inhabit the houses on
those narrow, twisting streets. The story was that a
dose of knockout drops had proved the turning point
in her life.</p>

<p>John Chinaman, you know, has a keen eye for the
beautiful, not only in decorative art and choice silks,
but in women.</p>

<p>There is his one weak point, the defective link in the
chain, the one vulnerable spot in the armor of his
stony reserve.</p>

<p>The lobbygows—the errand men of the Chinese—the
whites, who execute commissions for them, and do
all sorts of services, both legitimate and illegitimate,
who will work in the dark as well as in the light, and
whose heels can be hurried by extra compensation, saw
and noted this Queen also, and in seeing, they, too,
admired, but more or less hopelessly. The one spot
which is quick in a woman’s composition is adulation.
Let her be like ice, as cold and pure and reserved as
her likeness carved out of the whitest Parian marble,
or the hardest of flint-like granite, and admiration will
make her as soft and supple as a Cleopatra.</p>

<p>She comes into her own and knows it.</p>

<p>She smiles and looks about for a likely head upon
which to drop the wreath of her favors, and if she hesitates
it is because the right head has not been bowed,
or that her whim bids her hold off that she may only
succumb after a struggle.</p>

<p>I am not putting up any defense for this Chinatown
Queen. She was simply a woman with moods and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
humors, and pretty ways. Furthermore, which is essential
in most cases, she was good to look at.</p>

<p>So many were the affairs that she had that there is
no Solomon wise enough to tell how or when the first
one began. All that is known is that she dressed in
silks that were costly enough for a real queen, and
which smelled of the spices and perfume of the Orient.</p>

<p>When I say costly, I mean from a money standard.
They were more costly than that, so far as she was
concerned personally, for in the end they cost her her
life, and if she is not dead yet they certainly cost her
happiness, which really amounts to the same thing.</p>

<p>For a while she lived furiously, with anything she
wanted for the asking. Fine clothes, fine jewels, and
money to spend is part of every woman’s life.</p>

<p>More than that, it is a keystone.</p>

<p>Besides, she was the most prominent woman in all
the Quarter. For her that was fame and glory enough.</p>

<p>Had she been placed, by a fortunate move, somewhere
else on the chess-board of life, her fame might
have been more secure, but what difference does that
make, so long as she was satisfied?</p>

<p>It wasn’t long before her real life began, when her
steps, instead of being on the level or upward, traced
their gradual way downward.</p>

<p>That was inevitable in that case, just as it is in other
cases where constancy is an unknown virtue.</p>

<p>She passed from hand to hand like the chattel that
she was. She didn’t even consider the proposition of
the highest bidder, and start a hoard in some secret
place which would have been a life raft to her in the
turbulent days to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
She lived on promises, and those are false things
which fall to bits before adverse winds and threatening
weather. Her spirits rose and fell in an inverse
ratio to the rising and setting of the sun, and she took
no heed of the days to come. The seed of thrift failed
to find lodgment in her being.</p>

<p>And another thing, she never knew the real meaning
of the word opportunity.</p>

<p>In her early and halcyon days before the opium and
the night life had stamped its mark upon her face,
there came, with a party of sight-seers to Chinatown
one night, a man about town whose name stood for respectability,
good family and wealth. She, as Queen,
could not well be overlooked, and the guide took the
party to her apartments on the first floor of a dingy
tenement.</p>

<p>“What’s up here?” asked one of the party.</p>

<p>“Here is where de Queen of Chinatown lives,” responded
the guide. “Dis is de gal wots got all de gang
on de run, and as fer de Chinkys—why, dere ain’t one
uv dem wot wouldn’t croak a guy fer her.”</p>

<p>They filed into the room and looked at the girl as
they looked at the rest of the odd sights.</p>

<p>Let anybody rise above the human herd, even a short
distance, or do anything that is in the slightest way unusual,
and they are bound to find themselves in the center
of the spot light.</p>

<p>“Youse kin buy a drink off her, if yer like, or if yer’ll
cough up er bone apiece, she’ll show yer how to hit der
pipe,” announced the guide.</p>

<p>They thought it was worth a dollar each to see a
Queen smoking opium, and all cheerfully handed her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
the fee, with the exception of this one particular man,
who pressed five times the amount into her hand.</p>

<p>Curious things happen in this world of ours, and
here is one of them:</p>

<p>Two hours later, the same man, who had slipped
away from his party, hunted up the same guide, and
giving him a good-sized fee requested the honor of another
visit to the Queen.</p>

<p>The moral tone of Chinatown is not so high that
when the guide was dismissed he should feel at all
offended. He was perfectly satisfied, and he said so a
few minutes later as he was relating this story to some
of his friends in the saloon on the corner.</p>

<p>From this point the Queen herself takes up the tale.
She told it to her bosom friend, the Rummager, a
week later, and the Rummager’s eyes bulged and her
mouth opened as she heard it. More than once she
was inclined to disbelieve it, and said so, but the facts
were there and proven by the presence of certain articles
which could be accounted for in no other way.</p>

<p>“He was one of the real ones,” remarked the Queen,
“and I knew it as soon as I saw him. I have seen fellows
stuck good and strong, but he was the limit. He
was clean gone. When he came back the second time
he began as all the others do, by asking me how I came
to live in Chinatown. I told him to cut it out, and cut
it quick, and he took my tip. He didn’t lose a minute
telling me he liked me, either, and, say, he promised
me everything you could think of, up and down, if I
would cut the gang and go with him. He said I could
have the swellest flat that money could buy, and a
horse and carriage, if I liked. I thought he was kidding
at first, but he soon put me wise that he was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
goods. He chinned to me for about an hour, and then
he told me to put on my glad rags and he would take
me uptown to a feed. I was on in a minute, and nothing
but a cab would do for him. We went up on
Broadway, and the layout cost him $25, easy.</p>

<p>“We come down the line and butted into every joint
that had a light out, and every place we hit was a bottle
of wine. And every drink we took it was, ‘Well, will
you leave that crowd?’</p>

<p>“On the level, once or twice he had me going, but
when I thought of all the boys down here, and the
good times we’re having I couldn’t do it, and I told
him so. When I left him he was ossified for fair, and
he gave me these things to remember him by, he said.”</p>

<p>Whereupon the Queen showed up a roll of bills, a
scarf pin, a match box, and the Rummager believed.</p>

<p>She couldn’t afford to do otherwise very well, for
the Queen was, as usual, doing all the buying of
drinks, and the Rummager’s thirst has been compared
to a barrel of sponges.</p>

<p>It was only the other day that I found myself wondering
what had become of that pin and box. Where
have they been since then and who has owned them?
That they have fallen into many hands there can be no
doubt, and the first to get them was the pawnbroker.</p>

<p>But after that!</p>

<p>From silks the Queen went to calico. That is a great
chasm for any woman to cross, and from three rooms
she came down to one. Notice how easily the human
being can adjust itself to changes.</p>

<p>The nights of dissipation had begun to leave their
mark, and her throne was tottering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
The plumpness of her figure began to disappear, and
angles crept in to take the place of curves. Her eyes
were less bright, and her enthusiasm had lost its edge.</p>

<p>But she didn’t realize this.</p>

<p>She thought she was still Queen and she was living
on her past, just as many other real queens have, and
for that she is to be forgiven, for it is a woman’s right
to think herself the same as she was when she was at
her best.</p>

<p>It is the life buoy to which she always clings, and
when she dies her arms are found clasped about it with
the grip of death.</p>

<p>And then the day came when this Queen, a wisp and
shred of a woman, whose dreams had gone, and whose
calico had turned to rags, went down the street of the
Quarter one night never to return.</p>

<p>She had married a man of her class, and they went
into a tenement together.</p>

<p>Her sun had set—her day was done.</p>

<p>One day the priest was sent for to shrive her. I hope
there was consolation in his visit, because a dethroned
queen needs pity sometimes.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_5">A GIRL OF THE GOLDEN GATE</h2>
</div>

<p>When you go to the theatre, sit in a comfortable
seat, and look at the gay, laughing girls who are doing
all sorts of stunts in the front row, you are evidently
under the impression that their lives are simply one unending
series of revels and that they live in luxurious
ease. In your fancy you see them going to magnificent
apartments to enjoy late dinners washed down by
high-priced wine; you think, perhaps, that they dress
just as you see them on the stage, and that all they
have to do is ask for anything they happen to want and
it is theirs.</p>

<p>Your imagination paints you a wonderful picture of
love behind the scenes, but like children’s fairy tales,
half is a dream.</p>

<p>You are simply bringing into existence a mental
painting in very attractive colors, and if you could
make it real it would be a very fine thing for the girl
who makes up that she may look well from behind the
footlights.</p>

<p>There are few short cuts to the stage and the roads
are for the most part hard and tiresome. The woman
who gets there, and by that I mean the one who finally
lands with a reputation, usually has a past that would
make interesting reading—if it could be published,
which is out of the question.</p>

<p>To-day there is a woman in New York who is a star.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
So far as real talent is concerned she ought to have
been a star years ago, but there was some hitch and
she failed to connect.</p>

<p>She’s all right now, however, and when she pulls
down her fat bundle of bills every week she doesn’t
think of the old days on the Pacific Coast when she
was doing one turn an hour in the mining camps, and
well content if she got enough at the end of the show
to pay for her room and give her a balance on the side
to keep up her wardrobe—stage wardrobe, I mean—for
she didn’t seem to care much how she dressed when
on the street, and so far as that was concerned, she
was on the street very little, for reasons that are obvious.</p>

<p>She was a nice looking little girl in those days, full
of ginger and all that sort of thing, and she had the
kind of magnetism that made a good many men think
they couldn’t live without her. She was bright and
saucy, and happy-go-lucky, taking things as they
came, singing her songs with an abandon and grace
that went a long way toward filling up the house.</p>

<p>But it was when she danced that she was at her best.
That half-wild Spanish Cachuca made those rough
men rise to their feet and cheer her as if she was the
most wonderful girl in the world, and when the boys
were flush many a hundred dollars in gold went over
the flickering footlights to her feet, so that she really
and truly danced on gold. It was the Westerners’ way
of paying homage to anyone they liked, and it is done
to-day, but not to so great an extent.</p>

<p>You see, there was no limit on those fellows in the
blue shirts and bearded faces, and what was a handful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
of gold more or less to them then or at any other
time?</p>

<p>They were an open-handed lot, living only for the
day, and to the devil with to-morrow, lavishing all
they had upon anyone whom they liked.</p>

<p>As the money rolled in to her so it rolled out, easily
and without apparent effort, and at the end of a year
she had just what she started with—a couple of dresses,
the most part of which was tinsel.</p>

<p>And that brings me right back into the heart of this
story, the preliminary having been sufficiently long to
give you a thorough introduction to this little lady—queen
of the mining camps.</p>

<p>It isn’t likely you ever heard of a fellow who for
some romantic reason or other called himself Palo
Alto Bill. He was a tin horn gambler, good at short
cards, willing to take a chance at any proposition that
ever came over the hills, so long as he could figure in
it financially, but he had no heart. It was all Bill from
first to last, and he didn’t have enough generosity in
his entire system to drop a bone to a hungry dog. You
know the breed—they think they are all right, but they
are so eaten up with selfishness, and egotism, and vanity,
that they stride along with their elbows pushed
out, as if they were going to shove everybody else off
the earth.</p>

<p>He was handsome all right, with black hair—black
as an Indian’s—a curling mustache, and a wonderfully
taking way with a woman.</p>

<p>This was the combination that stacked itself up
against the little singer with the suggestion that they
travel in double harness for mutual benefit.</p>

<p>That was all there was to it.</p>

<div id="illo_6" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img src="images/i_050.jpg" width="439" height="638" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">A wonderful but untrue picture of love behind the scenes</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
He saw her, he liked her; why shouldn’t he have
her? And if she had been married it would have been
the same to him. He would in all probability have
suggested an elopement on a pair of fast horses.</p>

<p>“How long have you been in the business, Sis?” was
the way he started it.</p>

<p>He was smoking a cigarette at the time and he didn’t
even take the trouble to look at her, but holding his
head back, blew the rings of smoke, one after the
other, toward the low ceiling.</p>

<p>“Oh, about a year, and I’ve been making good ever
since I started.”</p>

<p>“That’s what you have. I suppose you’ve got a big
bunch of coin by this time, eh?”</p>

<p>“If I have I wish someone would find it for me.
There may be a lot of fun in the game, but there’s no
money, that is, not yet.”</p>

<p>“Well, let me give you just one straight tip. What
you want is a manager—someone to boom you. Suppose
you and I double up, and then I’ll show you how
to get the money, and hold it, too. Nothing cheap
about me. You’re a good fellow and I’m a good fellow,
and we can do well together. I’ll put you where
you belong, for you ain’t getting half of what’s coming
to you. How about it?”</p>

<p>Just remember that this was in the West, where a
girl has a mighty hard time of it without a protector
of some sort, and that there were a hundred tie-ups by
mutual consent for one real swell matrimonial clinch,
with a sky-pilot to sing his little song of “I now pronounce
you man and wife.” Also bear in mind that
she had known Bill about six months and that his style
rather appealed to her, because he was artistic in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
crude sort of a way, and besides, he wore his clothes
with a certain amount of grace that was good for the
female eye to look on.</p>

<p>So they tied up together and Bill began his life of
ease and prosperity. The next week was announced
as her grand farewell appearance, and she was the recipient
every night of a testimonial of so substantial
a character that, as she herself put it, her salary
seemed like pennies for candy. In these many testimonials
might have been recognized the fine Italian
touch of Bill, who had a Hermann-like knack of waving
his hands in the empty air and producing real
money. And while she was busy picking up the nuggets
and gold bucks which the enthusiastic miners
flung at her, he was attending to his end of the contract
by arranging a tour. He had a few schemes
under his hat that would have brought him in all kinds
of money if he had had a fair swing, but he was born
with the soul of a grafter, and that is very much like
a taint in the blood, in that it can never be effaced.
It may disappear for a while, but it is always liable to
turn up at the most unexpected time.</p>

<p>When the week was done the company started—the
company in this case being a couple of miners, who
were in hard luck and who went ahead of the show;
Bill and the girl.</p>

<p>I saw her the other night in a famous eating place
on Broadway putting away a chop and a small bottle,
and I wondered then if she remembered San Bernardino
that June morning when everything she had in
the world was held in one small bag which Bill carried.</p>

<p>The plan of procedure was simple. She was to get
a date in a town, Bill was to go around and boom her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
as the best that ever hit the Coast, and tell of the hit
she made in ’Frisco. Then when she came on the
stage to do her dance the two hobos were to start the
cheering. Toward the finish of the act one of them
was to walk down the aisle to the footlights and toss
up a handful of gold coins, and then the other was to
follow suit. That would start the crowd giving up;
for after all, people are like sheep, they will always
follow a leader.</p>

<p>It was a good stunt, and there wasn’t any chance for
a failure.</p>

<p>It worked out just as Bill figured it would, and it
kept him busy enough looking after the money end of
the game.</p>

<p>It was the turn in the tide for her so far as her
fortunes and popularity were concerned, and she simply
created a furore wherever she appeared. In those
days she wore a twenty-dollar gold piece around her
neck. It was held by a string which ran through a
hole she had bored herself with a great deal of labor.
It was the first piece of money she had ever received
over the footlights and she said it was her mascot, and
declared she would always keep it. It might have
been her mascot, but I’ll bet a hundred to one that
she hasn’t it now.</p>

<p>Put a good looking girl on the stage, have her make
a hit so that she is talked about, and she’ll attract more
men than a leg show in Paris. There’s an irresistible
fascination about the stage that makes even bald-headed
old papas fall. It’s a hard thing to figure out,
but it’s a fact, nevertheless.</p>

<p>In this particular case they flocked around her like
sheep for a shelter when a storm is in the air, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
girl took to wearing good clothes, ordered from
’Frisco, and using to their full capacity the services of
a maid.</p>

<p>And then there came upon the scene the other man.
He had hit the Coast from Colorado, and his mine was
turning out the yellow stuff so fast that he had more
than he could do to spend it. He was busily engaged
in the exciting pastime of buying everything he saw
when he met the girl that Bill was leading along the
golden road to wealth. There was nothing half-way
about his methods, so he promptly went out and
bought the biggest diamond he could find, put it in
an envelope upon which he wrote in lead pencil:</p>

<p>“The best stone for the nicest girl; come and have
a bottle of wine with me after the show.”</p>

<p>He didn’t need to sign his name to it, for the stage
hand who received a ten-dollar gold piece as a tip for
taking it to her pointed him out as he sat at one of the
tables well up toward the stage.</p>

<p>“He seemed to be kind of stuck on you,” he remarked
casually; “will I tell him you’ll see him?”</p>

<p>She put the ring on her finger and looked at it critically,
holding it first this way and that so that the light
would catch it. The inspection evidently pleased her,
for she said:</p>

<p>“Sure; he’s entitled to it after this.”</p>

<p>That is how it came about that, still in her stage
dress, she went directly from the stage to the table
where Croesus sat and smiled on him, while the diamond
flashed like a calcium.</p>

<p>One bottle broke the ice, two put them on a friendly
footing, and three made them lifelong friends. They
were on the fourth and their heads were close together.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
He was talking in a low tone, while she was listening
intently and nodding her head in affirmation every
moment or so when Bill happened along.</p>

<p>He didn’t like the looks of this and he showed it
plainly. He touched her on the shoulder with an air
of proprietorship and remarked curtly:</p>

<p>“Come on.”</p>

<p>“Who’s your friend?” asked the wine opener; “introduce
me.”</p>

<p>“I’m the real one,” said Bill.</p>

<p>“Husband?” asked the other, laconically.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Oh,” and his eyebrows were lifted a trifle. Then
he turned to Bill. “Sit down and have a drink; I
want to talk to you.”</p>

<p>Then the fifth bottle was brought on.</p>

<p>He held his brimming glass aloft.</p>

<p>“Wish me luck, old man, for I’m going to take this
little girl away from you,” and his blue eyes looked into
Bill’s black ones with a steady and disconcerting gaze.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ve got something to say about that,”
said Bill, putting his glass down suddenly.</p>

<p>“Not much. You see, I’m going to give you a
thousand dollars and that will be your meal ticket
until you find a new prima donna.”</p>

<p>“You made a mistake,” said Bill, “you meant
$5,000.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you; I did make a mistake; it’s $2,500,
and you’d better grab it quick, because it’s easy money
and it’s the limit, too.”</p>

<p>The girl was playing with the ring, turning it
around her finger aimlessly, never once looking and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
saying no word. Bill drained his glass, put it down,
and then looked at the stage.</p>

<p>“Do I get it now?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“Yes, now.”</p>

<p>He held out his hand, palm upward, with a suggestive
movement, and in just fifteen seconds it held
an order on the Assay Office for the amount. It was
as easy as going into a store and buying a blue flannel
shirt. Thirty days later—a record for speed, by
the way—the girl opened in San Francisco as the star
in a farce comedy on which ten thousand dollars had
been spent before the curtain went up. She had talent,
but not enough to make good, and after a week’s
losing run the play was shelved. She gained a lot of
experience and had a suite of rooms at the best hotel
in town, which was something for a girl who had
previously been housed in an eight by ten. That was
what gave her a running jump into the profession, so
to speak. She landed on both feet now, but none of
her friends would dare bring up the subject of the
glorious West to her.</p>

<p>That were best forgotten.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_6">WHEN FISTS WERE TRUMPS</h2>
</div>

<p>There was no reason why they should have called
the play “The Casino Girls” except that it might
have sounded attractive to the out-of-town people,
and the word Casino, in the mind of the average
manager, is always good for the money. But it
was a good show, nevertheless, with lots of nice
girls in tights and spangles, and you could spend
two hours there about as well as you could anywhere.</p>

<p>But this isn’t to be a story about a show in general,
nor is it written with the object of handing a bouquet
to the estimable gentleman who had the “Casino
Girls” under his wing. He had troubles of his own,
but he was paid for that. If some one would sit down
beside me for an hour or so—that is, some one who
knew—and tell me nice little stories about all of the
girls—or shall I say ladies?—with that show, I am
quite sure I would have enough material to last me
for a good many weeks to come, and it wouldn’t be
scandal, either. I should leave that for the religious
papers and a few of the sanctimonious dailies.</p>

<p>But it happens that just now I have only one good
card up my sleeve, so I’ll play that for all it is worth,
and then wait for something else to leak out and find
its way to the mahogany desk where I do stunts like
this one.</p>

<p>You will have noticed if you have seen the show,
one of the young women who is a bit more athletic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
than the others. She has a fist that can hand out a
scientific punch and an arm to back it up. She wears
tights with the rest of the crowd and doesn’t attract
special attention until the olio is put on, and then she
shines forth as a specialist. She punches the bag in a
manner that is truly marvelous, and what she doesn’t
do to that pear-shaped leather pendant couldn’t be
done by anybody—man or woman.</p>

<p>The medals dancing on her chest as she uppercuts
and swings would signify that she is an artiste of more
than usual merit, and the self-assurance and confidence
she displays during the brief time she is on
show that she is quite sure of herself and that she
knows the business from the make-up box to the bow
at the finish.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in addition to her other accomplishments,
she has been known to kick the crown of a hat
held six feet from the floor, which, by the way, is no
mean trick.</p>

<p>Now a few turns of the leaves of the calendar backward,
a wiping out of recent years, and you are at
the beginning of the story. Not in New York, but
in Ohio—the finish is in the big city, as all good
finishes are.</p>

<p>A good-looking, rugged girl was there; a normal girl
whose only heritage was health, strength and ambition,
which, by the way, in many cases, is better than
money. She took in all the shows that came to town,
and had about as good a time as any other girl could
have under the circumstances. She didn’t get stage
struck. She had no ambition to sing or dance before
the public, nor did she give a rap about Romeo and
Juliet. Nothing like that for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
You see her time hadn’t come and she had not yet
struck her gait.</p>

<p>The first intimation she had that she was stung
with the theatrical bee when she saw a bag-punching
act in which the man made many misses, but
faked it through so that it looked like the real thing.</p>

<p>That was what she had been waiting for all that
time and she never knew it. The next day she bought
a bag, had a platform rigged up and started in to
practice. She worked in a woodshed, I think it was,
with no one to teach her, and she hammered and
punched until she was about ready to drop from exhaustion,
but she never gave up. She would travel
anywhere to see a bag-punching act and get a few
tips, and although there were not many in the business
at that time, especially out in Ohio, the few she did
land told her all they knew and that wasn’t half
enough.</p>

<p>She had reached that stage when she was fairly
good, but didn’t know it, when there blew into the
town a 120-pound boxer of about the fourth class who
could pound the leather just enough to get a salary
that would pay his board and buy a few drinks, but
the fact that he was a bag puncher was enough for
her, so she made his acquaintance and hustled him
around to her improvised gymnasium to show her
what he knew. To her surprise there was nothing
in his routine that she wasn’t familiar with, and when
she went at the bag herself she did a few stunts that
made him open his eyes in amazement.</p>

<p>“Who put you next to that?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No one; I learned it myself.”</p>

<div id="illo_7" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img src="images/i_060.jpg" width="438" height="636" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">She has been known to kick the crown of a hat held six feet from the floor</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
“Ever do an act?” was the next question he shot at
her.</p>

<p>He had a quick mind—anybody has who knocks
around on the road for a few seasons—and he was
already beginning to figure.</p>

<p>“No, but some day when I get good I am going
to ask some kind manager to give me a chance.”</p>

<p>“You don’t have to wait any longer, Sis; you can
come with the show right away and we’ll do an act
together.”</p>

<p>Here was a meal ticket that would be good for
many a hard winter when the other fellows were
eating snowballs, and, if he could help it, it wasn’t
going to get away from him.</p>

<p>And that is the beginning of the story.</p>

<p>It didn’t get away from him, for he married her as
soon as he could find the money to pay a minister,
and that didn’t take very long.</p>

<p>He fixed up an act which might have been better,
but which was good enough to get work with reasonable
regularity. There was only one thing to it and
that was her bag punching, and if it hadn’t been for
his hustling around and getting dates he would have
been a rank case of excess baggage. In the meantime,
he was teaching her how to box, and when the act
grew stale they had a boxing finish that never failed
to go big with the crowd.</p>

<p>All this time she was learning. She hunted up
every bag puncher of note in the country and
gathered in the tips, and when she wasn’t busy with
anything else she was framing up something new for
herself. All this tended to give her a muscular development<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
that was worth having and that many
an athlete would have been proud of.</p>

<p>Her reputation was on the increase and she began to
be known. The first step had been made, and it became
a comparatively easy thing to get booking in
Europe. The skate she was tied to began to swell
up a bit, and during the seven days they were on the
ship bound for Liverpool he got it into his head that
he was the real one and that she was a side issue.</p>

<p>“Don’t ever forget,” he said to her when they
reached London, “that I am the real fellow. I dug
you out of a woodshed and put you where you are
now and if you try to get gay with me, I’ll send you
back there, and I’ll get another one just as good as
you are.”</p>

<p>He thought he was the real candy boy, and he
started in to cut a wide swath. He chased every
petticoat that came along, blew in their joint salary
at the cafes, and the only time she saw him was when
they were doing their act.</p>

<p>In Berlin she happened to walk in the cafe connected
with the music hall at which they were working,
and she saw him sitting at one of the tables trying
to fill a 160-pound blonde with Rhine wine.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it is about time to cut this out?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you to keep away from me and not
butt in where you’re not wanted?” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes; but I think I have something to say. I’m
not a wooden image, am I?”</p>

<p>“Who is this woman?” asked the blonde, languidly.</p>

<p>“I’m his wife, if you want to know,” was the retort,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
“and anyone would think you had no home by the
way you hang around here.”</p>

<p>“Tell her to go away; she annoys me.”</p>

<p>That was enough for the girl. With one swift jerk
the blonde was pulled to her feet, then a vicious right
hook found its way to her jaw, and as she dropped to
the floor the “meal ticket” walked away.</p>

<p>It was the first blow she had ever struck except in
a friendly contest with the gloves, and it stirred her
blood as nothing else had ever done.</p>

<p>It did another thing—it set her to thinking, and
from that time on she began a course of good, hard
training.</p>

<p>Something definite and tangible had become established
in her mind and she was after it like a hound
after a rabbit. She paid as little attention to him as
if he had never existed, and he carried on his love affairs—very
numerous ones they were, too—with a free
hand. He became a hot proposition, and he blew like
a drunken sailor on every girl who caught his fancy.
She lived like an automaton, doing everything mechanically
except the conditioning work she was engaged in.
At every show they boxed together, and once in a
while, when she would get a chance, she would whip
in a hard one in order to lay bare his weak spots.
One night she hit him in the stomach. It was a short,
sharp, snappy punch, and she felt the shock of it up
to her elbow.</p>

<p>He turned white under his grease paint and then
wobbled back a couple of paces.</p>

<p>When they came together again he whispered savagely:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
“Cut those out or I’ll hand you one the next time.”</p>

<p>“It was a slip,” she said. “I didn’t mean it.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing for you that you didn’t,” he answered,
surlily.</p>

<p>From Berlin they went to the Casino, in Paris, and
if the trick that was pulled off there had never happened
I wouldn’t be writing this story.</p>

<p>Paris to him was like a bone to a hungry dog and he
was a hot sport from the night they hit the town,
while she was a joke because she wouldn’t mix with
the bunch and play the game of love on her own hook.</p>

<p>But all the time she was getting ready for the
stunt that was to give her revenge and freedom together.</p>

<p>At last it came.</p>

<p>When he stumbled into the dressing room one
night he had the beginnings of a good-sized jag. He
had been putting away his share of absinthe and he
began to abuse her.</p>

<p>“You’re a dead one,” he said, “and I don’t know
what I ever saw in you. Here I’ve put you on your
feet and give you the chance of your life to make
good, but you don’t connect. Get in with the crowd
and be a live one before it’s too late, for you’re getting
to be a shine.”</p>

<p>“What do you expect me to do when you are mixed
up with a bunch of cheap soubrettes, and drunk half
the time?”</p>

<p>“Why, do the same as I do, of course. There’s that
guy that came in last night and wanted to meet you.
He’s got all kinds of coin, and——”</p>

<p>“Shut up,” she cried, “what do you think I am?”</p>

<p>“Not much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
She began working at her gloves viciously, pushing
the padding away from the knuckles so as to leave the
fist with as little covering as possible. You know the
trick if you’ve ever seen boxers just before a contest.
It isn’t considered the right thing to do, but when
done properly makes a punch well landed about twice
as effective. When she was through there wasn’t
much hair in the centre of her gloves, and then they
were ready to go on. They sang their opening song,
juggled the Indian clubs, after which she went at the
bag. That concluded, they were to go three rounds
to a quick finish.</p>

<p>They were ready.</p>

<p>He went forward to the footlights to make the
usual announcement.</p>

<p>“My partner and myself will now box three exhibition
rounds,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>“Time.”</p>

<p>When a man has been sparring exhibition rounds
very long he is apt to grow a trifle careless, and to
take chances that he wouldn’t take under ordinary
circumstances. It was so in this case, and at the first
rush he got a stiff, straight left in the mouth that
brought the blood oozing from between his lips.</p>

<p>“What the hell,” he began in amazement, but he
didn’t finish, for she was on him in an instant and a
short right went home to his ribs. He caught a look
in her eyes that suddenly sobered him, and he began
to stall and cover up. He retreated a few steps, and
she said tauntingly:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, are you afraid of me, you cur?”</p>

<p>He wavered for a moment and then she went after
him again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
He swung his right with all his might and caught
her on the ear. Somewhere from out of the audience
there came a sibilant hiss which was taken up by a
hundred at once. She needed that punch just about
that time, and it spurred her on, even though it hurt
for a moment. She bored in, and throwing down
her guard drove a right and left to his stomach—his
weak spot. There was the place, but she had forgotten
it in the excitement.</p>

<p>He dropped heavily and awkwardly on his back,
rolled over slowly and pulled himself to his feet. He
came up with a realizing sense that he must protect
himself against this woman who was taking an unfair
advantage of him, and in his ears rang the shouts and
applause of a delighted audience. He knew they were
not for him, but he would fight, anyhow, and show
them what he could do. They were to see that an
American boxer was no slouch. He saw her standing
there waiting, with a grim smile on her compressed
lips and he made up his mind that he would knock
that smile off. He straightened up and went at her
like a bull. She didn’t back off as he thought she
would, and when he pulled back his right he got a
jolt on the jaw that turned him half way around. He
went in again and she hit him in the stomach. When
his head dropped his nose met an uppercut that made
the blood spurt in a stream. The sight seemed to
madden her and she went at him fiercely and vindictively.
There was revenge behind every blow and she
felt that she was evening up the insults and humiliation
of a year. He was groggy and almost helpless
and there was pandemonium in the audience. Some
of the women had gone out, but those who had stayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
had risen in their seats and were cheering on this
American girl who was fighting like a man. She
heard nothing and saw only the man she loathed and
hated. She noted his puffed and bleeding face and
knew she had him.</p>

<p>“Put up your hands,” she said sharply.</p>

<p>He obeyed mechanically and she walked over to
him. He tried to cover up, but she feinted him into
an opening, and then drove a straight right to his
jaw and he flopped over in the wings crying:</p>

<p>“I quit, I quit; I didn’t think you’d do this.”</p>

<p>She didn’t even look at him as she went past to her
dressing room.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he came in with a trace of his
former bluster.</p>

<p>“What are you trying to do, anyhow?” he began,
but she shut him up.</p>

<p>“I’ll lick you again right here if you don’t keep your
mouth closed. From now on until the end of this engagement
<em>I’m</em> running this act, and I’m going to
collect the money for it, too, and any time I catch you
doing anything I don’t like <em>I’m</em> going to beat your
head off. Any time you think I can’t do it start something.
In just two weeks more you can pack your
clothes and shift for yourself, for I’m done.”</p>

<p>That’s all.</p>

<p>She has been shifting for herself ever since, and is
doing pretty well, thank you.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_7">KID AND HIS TEN THOUSAND</h2>
</div>

<p>Just another restaurant scene with waiters and
guests and steaming dishes and wine.</p>

<p>It’s the same old thing, repeated many times a day,
but it’s like a stage on which a thousand plays have
appeared. The setting is always the same—it’s only
the scene that changes.</p>

<p>I just want to call your attention to that red-cheeked
boy at the table over by the window. I said boy,
although from the standpoint of years he is really
a man. But he lacks experience to bring him to a
man’s real estate. Years, you know, don’t always
count in this world, that is, not in all things. In this
woman is excepted, because years count for everything
with her.</p>

<p>This particular boy has just had his first experience,
and that is the excuse for this story—if an excuse is
needed. He has laid the foundation stone upon which
he is going to build his life, and in the building he will
use many stones of many colors, sizes and shapes.</p>

<p>You see him sitting there disconsolate, miserable and
wretched. His home, as luxurious a one as anybody
would want, is not more than a dozen blocks away,
and he will wind up there in the course of the next
forty-eight hours, for he is practically broke.</p>

<p>I call him The Boy With The Ten Thousand Dollar
Bill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
Just a few years ago his father died. A few weeks
later the family lawyer was in the drawing room reading
the will of the deceased, and near the end of the
document he came to a clause which stipulated:</p>

<p>“On his twenty-first birthday my son shall receive
from the balance of moneys unexpended a bill of the
denomination of $10,000 to do with as he shall see fit,
and he shall not be asked to account for the expenditure
of it to anyone in any way whatsoever.”</p>

<p>That was a curious item for even a curious will, but
the estate was big and the founder of that fortune felt
evidently that he could afford to experiment with a
mere ten thousand, even after his death, that the lesson
might be of benefit to the heir.</p>

<p>The object is obvious.</p>

<p>The boy became of age, and on that day he received
the bank note which to him seemed like a fortune, so
he felt that he owned the world.</p>

<p>A man can do a lot of good in New York with that
amount of money, and a boy can do a lot of harm.</p>

<p>This boy knew in advance the good fortune that was
coming to him, and in looking around he made up his
mind that the first thing a man of his means should
buy would be an automobile costing $4,000, so the day
he got the money he bought the car, and he received
in exchange a bundle of crisp five hundred bills.</p>

<p>He must have thought those bills represented the
wealth of Croesus, or that they were magic, and no
matter how many he might use, some mysterious
agency would replace them.</p>

<p>At 11.30 o’clock that night the new automobile was
backed up against the stage door of a Broadway playhouse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
and half an hour later it was filled with as many
girls as could possibly be crowded in.</p>

<p>In that startling way the boy with the big bill made
his debut into the society of the line. He gave the girls
a dinner that they are talking of yet, and before two
hours had gone by they were calling him pet names
and incidentally trying to get a line on the actual size
of his bank roll. They worked individually, and each
one could in fancy see herself installed in a fine house,
mistress of unlimited means and the wife of an especially
easy mark, made to order for a chorus girl.</p>

<p>You see he was so liberal that he deceived them, although,
as a matter of fact, young ladies with their
wide experience ought to have known better, and have
figured out the limit of his possibilities.</p>

<p>These ten thousand dollars were left by the dead
man to be a bait for the wolves, and he had arranged it
so that the hand of his son should feed it to them bit
by bit. There were other thousands behind these
and they were to be protected by the knowledge of the
fate of the ones which had gone before. It was willed
that ten thousand dollars of experience might be
bought with it, and the boy was doing his share of it
very well. He left his home and took a nice little
apartment so that he could have more liberty, which he
needed just about that time. He lunched with a soubrette
and dined with a singer. If he liked a show or
fancied one of the girls in it, he engaged a box every
night for the week. The crowd dubbed him The Little
Millionaire, and he deserved the title, for he was
certainly playing the star part, and he was always present
at what are known as rackets where the chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
source of amusement were girls who cut capers and
danced to the music of male voices.</p>

<p>His automobile, which always carried a bunch of
freight from which ribbons and feathers fluttered, denoting
the sex of the wearers, of course, shot up and
down and in and out in a most spectacular manner,
and it, as much as anything else, helped to make him
popular.</p>

<p>He must have known a bit about finance, for it
looked to those who were watching his career as if
he was spending about ten thousand a week, and so
he got the reputation of doing—as sometimes happens
in this world—that which was impossible.</p>

<p>But through it all he never showed his hand.</p>

<p>He was dining one night with an especially nice little
girl of the stage to whom he had shown a lot of attention—which
means in stage parlance that he had
bought her presents worth accepting.</p>

<p>They had come to the third bottle of wine, and to
her way of thinking, the time seemed about ripe for
what she had in mind.</p>

<p>“A man who’s been in the business a long time was
telling me the other night that I ought to have a show
of my own,” she mused, as she sipped her wine.</p>

<p>She had made a careful and skilful cast and she
waited.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you?” he asked presently.</p>

<p>That was quicker action than she had dared to expect.</p>

<p>“I ought to have done it two years ago when I had a
friend that wanted to start me out on the road. Don’t
you think I’m as good as Blanche Bates?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
“How was it you didn’t go?” he queried, ignoring
her question.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, I didn’t like this party, and I wouldn’t
accept favors from no one I didn’t like. It don’t
cost much to put a show on if you know how, and
there’s a lot of money in it if it’s a hit.”</p>

<p>“About how much?”</p>

<p>“Twelve or fifteen thousand dollars would do it up
in great shape. I think a nice little comic opera would
be good. The kind Lillian Russell has. All she
makes good on is her looks and that’s not so much.
I could take a few music lessons while the play was
being fixed up and it wouldn’t be long before I could
make them all sit up and look me over.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause and then she aimed at
the bull’s eye:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you backing it?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I was just thinking about,” was the
answer. “I’ll look into it and if it’s all right I’ll see
my broker and give you a chance to see what you can
do as a star.”</p>

<p>He was talking like an old timer and he had her
going in a minute. But that was only one of his jokes
and for two weeks he kept it up. Then he told her of
some enormous investments he had made which had
tied him up temporarily, while she had to go around
explaining to her friends that it was all off about what
she had been telling them.</p>

<p>There was one proposition this gay young sport
hadn’t figured on, for all going out and nothing coming
in makes a quick and, as a rule, a spectacular finish.
A fellow starts out like a three-time winner and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
comes under the wire with nothing but a bundle of
junk, without even knowing his right name.</p>

<p>Two months of the three had gone by and the most
remarkable part of the whole affair was that there was
any money left. But toward the latter part of the
game he had been growing wise, or he thought he was,
at any rate. He stopped the five-dollar tips and he was
cutting out a night here and there. He might have
retired with honors if he hadn’t met Blanche.</p>

<p>Good-looking, slick, clever Blanche, the regret of
whose life was that she hadn’t met him first and got it
all in one solid chunk. He didn’t know it, but he was
made for Blanche, and what was more to the point,
she knew it. In fact, there were very few things she
didn’t know.</p>

<p>His talk about his brokers didn’t switch her in the
least. There had been a time in her life when she
might have believed it, but that time had gone by. She
had lived in a fool’s paradise just once and that was
enough for her.</p>

<p>He actually wanted to marry her, but she wouldn’t
consider it for a moment, because she didn’t figure him
out as a future proposition for more than a couple of
thousand at the most.</p>

<p>“You’re all right, Harry,” she said once, “but we
won’t have any marrying just now. What we will do
is go shopping. I want to furnish a flat so I can really
have a home of my own and you will be just as welcome
there as if you owned it yourself, so come along
and we’ll pick the things out. You have very nice
taste in such matters, I know, and we can have a good
time buying.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
Good speech that, and very nicely delivered, and he
liked her well enough to find no flaw in it. But when
the time really came for the buying there was something
else she had to do, so she said:</p>

<p>“Don’t you bother your head about this; just give
me the money; I know what I want; I have the list all
made out. I’ll buy them and fix them up and when
everything is ready I’ll have you come up and look at
them and tell me what you think. I know my taste is
not as good as yours, but I’ll do the best I can.”</p>

<p>Please bear in mind that he was only a boy—just
twenty-one years old—then you will understand perhaps
why it was he fell for so old a story.</p>

<p>At this point you’ve got it all figured out. In your
opinion she took the coin and simply faded away.</p>

<p>Nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>He saw her once every twenty-four hours at least
and she reported progress, and then one day he got a
note telling him to come up and see the new place.</p>

<p>She received him at the door herself and if the little
flat had been a palace she couldn’t have been more delighted.
It was so very fine that when she told him
she had gone into debt just a little bit he promptly
asked how much and paid up without even so much as
a murmur. It was so easy that she ought to have
given it back to him a little while just to hold.</p>

<p>When he went away he had a latch key and was
about as proud a fellow as it was possible to be and
walk straight.</p>

<p>As in a play so in a story—the finish is everything.</p>

<p>It must be good and it must be quick.</p>

<p>The earlier parts of the story or the scenes may lag,
but nothing like that will do at the end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
Blanche had been on the stage, and consequently
she knew the value of “finis.”</p>

<p>He was to go on a hunting trip for a week, and in
her opinion the critical moment had about arrived.
She intuitively divined the end of the string. One
night at a little dinner in the flat she talked to him
about money matters, and such was the charm of her
manner that presently he was telling her all about himself,
and the romance of the ten thousand dollar bill.</p>

<p>“And how much have you left of all this?” she
asked softly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know, about seven or eight hundred.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think you’ve been very, very foolish.
You’re going away on a week’s trip and a hundred
really ought to do you. Just give the rest to me and I
will take good care of it until you come back, and then
you will have it. You want to be careful of what you
have now; you are altogether too liberal, and you do
too much for people.”</p>

<p>That was the reason when he went away on that trip
that he was a trifle shy financially, and so far to the
bad that he had to borrow to get back in good shape.</p>

<p>From the Grand Central station he took a cab to the
flat. It seemed as though he couldn’t get there quick
enough. He went up the stairs two at a time. He
came to the door.</p>

<p>There was a light, dim, but still a light, shining
feebly over the transom. He put the key in the lock,
turned it, opened the door and went in. He took four
steps in the private hall. Then a man’s arm went
around his neck and a voice asked:</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>He had nerve and he wasn’t the least bit flustered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
“If you’ll let go that strangle I’ll tell you,” he said.
“Where’s Blanche?”</p>

<p>That was the opening for the story, which he told
very well under the circumstances.</p>

<p>“She never owned this furniture,” spoke up the
man, when the tale had been concluded. “This flat is
rented furnished. She left here about a week ago, and
I live here now.”</p>

<p>Now we get the curtain.</p>

<p>He has finished his dinner, and he’s going home.
That’s the best place anyhow. What right has a boy
like that to be on Broadway with ten thousand dollars?</p>

<h2 id="hdr_8">AN ORIENTAL NOCTURNE</h2>
</div>

<p>It’s just one little step—in New York, anyhow—from
the Caucasian to the Oriental. As a matter of
fact it’s only across the street, and that doesn’t count
for any distance at all. The Chinese have settled
down on that little part of the city which is split into
wedge-shaped blocks by Mott, Pell and Doyers streets,
very much like a flock of birds alight on some tree,
and with apparently as little reason. They have
brought with them their manners, their customs, their
habits and their traditions. They have imported their
own gods, and even the furniture for the joss houses.
They have introduced to American men and women
the choices of their Oriental vices, that of opium smoking,
and they have provided places where their patrons
may enjoy the drug. They wash your shirts and iron
your collars; they take your money and smile at you;
they go to your Sunday schools and sing hymns in
queer cracked voices that would be worth big money to
a comedian, and they profess to be converted to your
way of thinking, but they are smooth and wise.</p>

<p>They are never weaned from the worship of Confucius
or Tao, or Buddha, as the case may be, but don’t
you see when a Chinese wants to learn the language
of the people with whom he lives, it is very nice
to have as a teacher a nice looking girl, and the English
of the Bible is no different than any other English.
So, by saying he has foresworn the gods and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
faith of his fathers, he gets his education directly from
the red lips of a daughter of the white devils, and
sometimes he puts on the finishing touches by marrying
her.</p>

<p>Can you beat it?</p>

<p>Much he thinks of women, for in that Empire from
whence he comes a woman is a chattel, a bit of merchandise,
worth so much in money or goods, as the
case may be, and he buys her as a white man buys a
horse. She is his wife, his mistress, or his servant,
and the price fluctuates accordingly.</p>

<p>When Yen Gow, the slickest Oriental that ever
cooked a pill, hit Mott street for the first time, he
noticed that there were very few women of his race in
the colony, and being a man who made money, no
matter by what means, he considered it was an evil
that he was in duty bound to remedy. He had a varied
career, and among other things being an expert, he
had taught American women how to smoke “hop.”</p>

<p>Incidentally, it is pat to say here that Yen Gow represents
a man and not a dummy, and that this story
is absolutely true in every detail and is very far removed
from fiction.</p>

<p>If you haven’t what you want, get it, is a maxim
practiced by a certain class of people in all countries in
the world whose methods, both from a moral as well
as a legal standpoint, are not considered to be exactly
right. So being shy one female of his own blood and
color, Yen took a 3,000 mile ride to ’Frisco to remedy
the defect. No one knows just how deep he had to
dig for that slant-eyed lady, dressed in the clothes of a
boy, whom he smuggled into the top floor of a Mott
street tenement one night. But it was his investment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
and he spent his money like another man would buy
ground or buildings.</p>

<p>He fitted the room up with couches and curtains and
furniture, but first of all he fitted a good, strong lock to
the door that couldn’t be tampered with either from
the inside or outside unless one had the key. There
was only one key and he had it. When you buy property
that has feet you are not inclined to take chances.</p>

<p>Having attended to all of the details that he considered
necessary, and frightened the lady by telling
her that the people of New York were cannibals who
liked nothing better than Mongolian flesh, he began to
do business.</p>

<p>He first lounged into the fan-tan joint of Hop Lee
on Pell street.</p>

<p>“Have you ever heard of Moy Sen?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Moy Sen; who is she?”</p>

<p>“Who is she? Were you born yesterday? There
are three hundred and twenty girls in ’Frisco, and they
are as little like Moy Sen as the earth is like the sun.
Why, the viceroy of the Shang-tuan province heard of
her and sent an envoy with nothing to do but look at
her and if she was what they said she was, to bring
her back even if it cost him ten thousand taels.”</p>

<p>“Did he get her?”</p>

<p>“Can a child get a rainbow? She heard he was coming,
so she dressed in the clothes of a working boy and
ran away to New York.” He stepped a little closer
and whispered: “She is here now.”</p>

<p>Then he cunningly told his story, and when he had
finished he had made it clearly understood for what
purpose she was here, and added further that being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
an utter stranger she had placed herself under his
care.</p>

<p>“Now, if you care to see her I will take you.”</p>

<p>Nothing could be simpler—nor plainer.</p>

<p>In figuring up his profits—which were large—Yen
Gow got into the habit of multiplying them by two, and
then mentally cursing himself because he had not
bought two slaves instead of one. With no conscience
and no morals, he was a thing of stone whose only
thought was the easy acquirement of money. If, by
cutting off a finger or an ear from his chattel he could
have increased her value, he would have done it with
as little compunction as lopping off a chicken’s head.</p>

<p>When the money didn’t come in fast enough he
took to beating her, and it wasn’t long before the slim,
brown body of the girl began to take on bluish spots
where the knots in the rope had struck and left their
imprint. She had never known there was such a thing
in the world as love, but she began to hate with a
fierceness and vindictiveness that any woman is capable
of when she has been wronged, no matter of what
race or nationality she may be.</p>

<p>Revenge follows closely on the heels of a woman’s
hate, and it is always deadly. One woman can hate
another woman and still smile on her as if she was the
dearest and best friend in the world, while she is waiting
to let go her poisoned shaft. But she has no smiles
for the man she hates any more than a cat will purr
when it has just had an encounter with a dog.</p>

<p>Many a night when the sightseeing crowds were
going through Chinatown’s streets the girl looked at
her captor, and let her tapering hand slip inside the
loose fold of her silk blouse until it caressed the jade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
handle of a long, thin and keen-edged blade. If he
had known how near death he was he would have put
his back against the wall and pulled out that big American
revolver he always carried in his sash. But not
knowing he went along with his head up in the clouds.</p>

<p>Because her heart was the heart of a woman she
stopped feeling for the knife and set her mind on other
things, such as any caged animal would under the circumstances.
It was finally concentrated on the key—that
slim piece of metal which he never let out of his
keeping day or night. It gave her courage to live the
life she was leading, and the thought spurred her on,
for at last she had an object.</p>

<p>The long, lean, gray wolf of the prairies will follow
its prey for days. Hungry and thirsty and tired it will
trail like a shadow, never once deviating from the
heels of its victim. Through snow, and rain, and sleet,
and wind, surmounting all obstacles it will stay until
the end, and the end to the wolf always means the
feast.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the veins of this Chinese girl there
must have been one drop of wolf blood, for once she
set her mind upon the possession of that key she never
wavered. It was before her night and day. She
planned a thousand ways to get it, but never one was
right. She watched him with furtive eyes, but for all
the good it did, she might just as well have been
looking out of the window of the dreary brick wall of
the other building.</p>

<p>Once when he was sleeping she crept silently to his
side and felt for the inner pocket of his blouse. Slight
as was her touch he must have felt it, for he moved
uneasily and she fluttered to the floor like a leaf from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
falling tree. She tried again, but with the same result.</p>

<p>But out of what seems certain failure often comes
success.</p>

<p>“I am hungry; get me something to eat quick,” he
demanded when he awoke in the morning.</p>

<p>She started up and set about her work while he
walked over to the table to get his water pipe. As she
passed back and forth from cupboard to stove her
glance fell upon the couch where he had slept, and for
one brief moment it seemed as though she was going
to fall. A sudden weakness came into her knees and
it was with a great effort that she kept from crying
out, for there in plain view was the key. In an instant
she had it, and she had taken the first and easiest
step to freedom.</p>

<p>He smoked, then ate, then smoked again, but this
last time it wasn’t tobacco that soothed him—it was
opium, and when at last his drowsy eyes closed she
was by the door pushing the key into the socket. It
turned the lock. Then she opened the door, passed
out and locked it on the outside. She ran down the
steps as if she was pursued; out on the street, when
the thought of those white devils—those eaters of human
flesh—halted her in terror. But no one spoke to
her and she was reassured. Across the way she saw
the sign of a temple, and she made for it as a shipwrecked
sailor makes for land. She went up one flight
of very dark and very dirty stairs and then saw a half-opened
door. She peeped in. The room was empty,
but at the back were the images of the gods she knew
in China; before them was the shrine, and back of
them was the sacred place where no one dared go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
But nothing is sacred where terror is, and before ten
seconds of time had been ticked off by the clock on
the wall she was nestling at the heels of Kwon Guet,
the God of Might, the safest spot in all the quarter.</p>

<p>If you will notice when you visit a Chinese joss
house you will observe that there is nothing thin nor
weak about the keeper. He looks like a man who
loves the good things of life and gets them, too. His
life is one of ease and he feasts like a nabob. When
a Chinese wants a favor from a joss he first sends
offerings of food. These are put in fine dishes and
placed on the altar. Then he prays, and begs that this
feast be accepted in the same spirit in which it is sent.
He may believe or he may not believe that that thing
of wood eats what he has left, but the keeper knows
and waxes fat. Many a time has he smacked his lips
over a sucking pig, roasted to a turn, and chickens are
on his daily bill of fare.</p>

<p>Two hours after the girl had gone through the open
door the keeper awoke. He yawned and then stretched
himself, leisurely. He was in no hurry, for he knew
there was a breakfast awaiting for him on the altar,
and it was such a breakfast as a man of his distinction
was entitled to. He knew to a grain of rice what had
been put there the night before just as he had known it
for years.</p>

<p>Presently he was ready and he sauntered out of his
little room with no unseemly haste. The wick in the
vessel of olive oil was burning with a steady glow and
the faces of the gods were as placid and emotionless as
the day they left the carver’s shop in Pekin.</p>

<p>“Ai yei.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
He rubbed his eyes and stepped back a pace in
alarm.</p>

<p>One of the dishes was empty. It was as bare and
clean as the palm of his hand. He ran back to the
room in the rear and roughly woke his assistant.</p>

<p>“You have eaten before me, you swine,” he shouted.</p>

<p>“Eaten?” queried the other. “I have not eaten
since yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Come and look then.” Together they both went,
and when they arrived at the altar another dish had
been taken.</p>

<p>The keeper looked up at the stolid countenance of
Kwon Guet, saw a shred of the white meat of a chicken
and a grain of rice on his lower lip, and then
dropped face downward on the floor as if he had been
shot.</p>

<p>He grovelled in abject terror while the assistant
gazed at him with wondering eyes, until he, too, looked
up, saw the same sight, and then he went down beside
his master. There they both lay until combining their
courage, they crept fearfully backward beyond the
range of the vision of those green jade eyes.</p>

<p>“It is a curse,” whispered the keeper, and the other
nodded his head, too frightened to speak.</p>

<p>That was only the beginning, for as fast as the offerings
were brought they disappeared, and nothing was
left but empty dishes. For eight days this continued,
and then, on the night of that day, the keeper, grown
bold, found the desire to see a god eat growing in his
heart. So when the lights in the shops had gone out
and the noises in the street had died down to whispers,
he went out into the darkened temple and sat in a corner
with his back against the wall. The flickering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
lamps burned dimly and cast long shadows across the
bare floor and with solitude came fear. He looked
at the heaped-up dishes hungrily and then at the joss,
but the religion of his ancestors held him fast, and
what might have been nothing more nor less than a
block of wood to another man of another race was
something to him that was endowed with the power to
pardon and punish or even cause instant death.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came to him a noise like a sigh, long-drawn
out and deep, and as he shrunk back still further
in his corner he felt the blood in his veins run cold.
A dish moved and his lower jaw dropped as though he
had been stricken with death. Something seemed to
wind itself about that bit of crockery and drag it slowly
in until it disappeared, but there was no sound. His
breath came in gasps and he felt as if he would choke.
Then he saw the dish replaced with the food gone.
Those same unseen hands took another one and still
another, but he didn’t see, for he had sagged down in a
lifeless heap and terror had numbed his senses. As
he went over he groaned aloud, and there was a sudden
movement back of the altar which almost caused Kwon
Guet to topple over.</p>

<p>At three o’clock in the morning Chuck Connors,
with his hands thrust deep in his trousers pockets, was
walking along Mott street, homeward bound, when a
Chinese girl came running out of the joss house door.
So great was her speed that she almost collided with
him.</p>

<p>“Ha, there, git onto yerself,” said Chuck, putting
up his hands to fend off an imaginary blow: “wot are
yer tryin’ ter do—shoot de shoots?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
“Velly much aflaid,” said the girl, looking behind
her.</p>

<p>“Well, wot de yer t’ink uv dat,” said Chuck, “Who’s
chasin’ yer, anyhow?” and he took a step toward the
doorway.</p>

<p>But she wouldn’t have it that way, and taking hold
of his arm she almost dragged him away from the
place. Chuck knows a little Chinese and a lot of pidgin-English,
and he managed to get some kind of a
story out of the girl, and then he took her home and
put her in the care of Mrs. Chuck until the
morning. The next day she was taken to a mission
house in Brooklyn, where she stayed until one night
when a sporty laundryman smuggled her away to
Savannah, Ga.</p>

<p>The joss-house keeper buys his grub now, and he’s
looking a bit thin. Incidentally he pays more attention
to the temple than ever before.</p>

<p>So, you see, good comes out of everything.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_9">A COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION</h2>
</div>

<p>The turn of a street corner, the going this way instead
of that, the casual introduction to a certain woman,
and a thousand other things often prove the turning
point in life, sometimes for good and sometimes
for bad. To every man opportunity comes once at
least. The successful ones are those who have recognized
their chance and taken prompt advantage of it.
But anyone can preach a sermon, and money doesn’t
always follow in the footsteps of education.</p>

<p>That will do for a starter to this story of a woman,
a dinner and two men. You will notice that the woman
comes first, the dinner next, and the men last, which
is as it should be. Women should always be in the
lead, which fact will be more fully recognized when
their ability and genius become more generally understood
and appreciated.</p>

<p>The dinner in this story changed the current of three
lives so abruptly that it almost became a tragedy, and
if you like you can take this as a moral, and beware of
dinners, unless, of course, you are looking for a
change, in which event you can take this as a tip and
dine with the crowd early and often and see what
happens.</p>

  <div class="caption">There was disclosed the figure of a young woman rather scantily clad</div></div>

<p>The son of a wealthy Eastern brewer, born with a
gold spoon in his mouth, and taught to believe that the
world was made for his especial benefit, after blazing
his way along the White Light thoroughfare for a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
years, and making a name for himself as a spender of
rare ability, took it suddenly into his head to reform.
A good many hard nights had brought out a crop of
fine wrinkles at the corners of his eyes, and high living
had added several inches to his waist line. But he
was still good looking and ruddy cheeked, and there
were a number of charming ladies living on certain
side streets who knew him well enough to call him by
his first name, and who were always glad to see him
whether he did the sucker trick of opening bad wine at
$5 a throw or not. In his mind the first step toward
reformation meant marriage with some nice respectable
young woman who had been correctly brought up,
and whose family tree would bear investigation, and
as his income was somewhere in the neighborhood of
$30,000 it wasn’t hard to find what he wanted, for
ninety-nine women out of a hundred would cheerfully
fasten themselves to a monstrosity if there was a bank
book in the inside pocket.</p>

<p>He picked out the girl he proposed to turn from a
Miss into a Mrs., paid attention to her for thirty days
without a break, then he proposed and was accepted,
and the date of the marriage was set for two months
later. It was a case of thirty and sixty days, with no
discounts off.</p>

<p>It is usual in a case of this kind to give a farewell
dinner to the bunch, to have one last good drunk and
then a laborious climb aboard the water wagon until
after the honeymoon. So he hunted up one of his best
friends and told him the glad news.</p>

<p>“Never again for me,” he said, “and all the Dotties
and Lotties and Totties can strike my name off their
lists, for I’m going to marry, old man, and settle down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
to business. But I’m going to have one big blaze before
I go, and I want you to get it up, for you can lay
out a dinner better than anyone I know, and besides,
I’m going to have you for my best man when I get
hitched. Now go as far as you like and damn the expense.
Have a stag with all the good fellows there
that we know, and we’ll set off a few fireworks that
will give them something to talk about.”</p>

<p>The banquet room of a big hotel was engaged, and
the French chef got an order to lay out a spread that
would make an old Roman feast look like a Bowery
beef stew. Then the enterprising best man, who was
something of a high roller himself, set his wits to work
to devise a novelty that would top anything in the banquet
line ever seen in New York after the lights were
turned on. About fifty invitations went out, and in
response to them on one eventful Saturday night, half
a hundred dyed-in-the-wool sports, of the kind who
buy diamond rings for little ladies who dance well, settled
themselves in very comfortable chairs, and prepared
to have the time of their lives and wish good
luck to the man who was going to become respectable.
The dinner was only a side issue, for it was to be nothing
more nor less than one great drunk, and that was
understood from the start. So the wine flowed as freely
as water in the spring when the melting snows flood
the brooks and swell the rivers, and for every five men
there was one waiter to see that no one went thirsty.
From ten until twelve the black-jacketed servitors
drew corks and filled glasses, and then the best man
pulled himself to his feet, propped himself between the
arm of his chair and the table and commanded order
that he might be heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
“There is a pudding coming,” he began, “and in
view of the fact that I invented it myself I would like
to have you fellows sit up and take notice.”</p>

<p>Then he motioned to the head waiter and sank back
in his chair. Five men, each one holding up his end
of a platform about four feet square on which was a
monstrous concoction of pastry, staggered in. A vacant
place had been cleared on the table, and when
it was placed in position a yell went up from the
crowd.</p>

<p>“I’ll take a slice off the top,” sang the bridegroom,
as he waved a glass of wine aloft.</p>

<p>“Cut it, Bill,” said the best man, and one of the
waiters, grinning, went at it with a huge carving knife.
He slit it from top to bottom in two places, and as the
crust crumbled away half a dozen birds fluttered out,
and when the pastry cook’s creation was demolished
there was disclosed a young woman rather scantily
draped and with a figure worth missing a train for.</p>

<p>“Good evening, gentlemen,” she said, smiling, and
then she stepped out.</p>

<p>People who make a study of such things will tell you
for every man in the world there is just one woman
who belongs to him. They may be thousands of miles
apart, and it may so happen that they will never meet,
but the fact remains that they were intended for each
other just the same. He may marry and she may
marry, but there will be no real, true happiness until
they live their lives together. When this girl, trim
and slim but shapely, stood on the table, the man who
was going to be married looked on her and knew then
that there was no other woman in the world for him—not
even the one whom he had promised to marry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
The others stood up and cheered and applauded her,
while he sat there staring almost stupidly. Her bronze
hair tumbled down over her bare shoulders and her
laughing eyes took in the scene.</p>

<p>“And who is the one who is going to be married?”
she asked smilingly. “I want to drink with him.”</p>

<p>“Get on your pins, old man, and drink with the
lady,” called one, and he obediently arose and held a
glass of wine toward her.</p>

<p>“So you are the one?” she asked, looking him over
critically. “Well, here is that the woman you marry
is as good a fellow as you look to be.”</p>

<p>That was at midnight.</p>

<p>When the clock struck two every guest was still in
his place, and seated in the lap of the man at the head
of the table—the host, the man who was to marry,
become straightened out, and shake the crowd—was
the girl. He had one arm around her, and they were
drinking out of the same glass. Of course it wasn’t at
all proper, but you see everything goes at a bachelor’s
dinner, and in view of the fact that this was a last wild
fling, apparently, it was all right. It was nobody’s
business, anyhow, for a man may do as he likes even
if he is on the verge of his own wedding.</p>

<p>“You will surely call,” she was saying between sips.</p>

<p>“Surely,” was the answer, “if you will allow me.”</p>

<p>“And if I don’t?”</p>

<p>“Then I will call anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Now you’re just the kind of a man I like,” she
whispered. “But what are you going to do after
you’re married?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I will marry,” he said; “at least I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
not marry the girl I intended. You and I are going to
talk that over, because——”</p>

<p>“Why, I’ve only known you about two hours.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t make any difference if you’d only
known me two minutes, it would be just the same.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, but you see a good many men have
talked to me like that, and promised me everything,
but it’s always the same in the end. Men say things
that they mean at the time, but it doesn’t last.”</p>

<p>He was really in earnest, though he was drunk, and
the next afternoon, when he was sober enough to know
what he was doing, he wrote a note to his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fiancee</i>, telling
her that he was sorry, but it was all off. There
were reasons, of course, but he couldn’t explain, and
would she kindly release him from his engagement,
which had been entered into too hastily, etc., etc. You
know the old story.</p>

<p>In the end he got his freedom in a tear-stained letter,
then he went and threw a high-ball under his belt and
squared away for the pudding girl.</p>

<p>She was making about $40 a week and living at the
rate of about $150, it didn’t take a wise man to see that,
and so he was on the moment he looked over the ranch.
But it cut no figure with him at all, for he was too
well satisfied to be bothered about a trifle like that,
especially at the start of the hunt, so he took things
as they came and made the best of them.</p>

<p>One night he was there, and they had become confidential.</p>

<p>“Who did it all?” he asked, as he waved his hand to
take in the elaborate furnishings of the room.</p>

<p>“So you have reached the curious stage?” she asked.
“What do you want to know for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
“Because I think so well of you that I want to do all
this sort of thing myself. Who did it?”</p>

<p>She looked thoughtfully out of the window for a
moment, and then, as if she had suddenly made up
her mind, she turned and said:</p>

<p>“Would it make any difference to you if you knew?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit.”</p>

<p>“Not even if it was someone whom you knew?”</p>

<p>“Not even then.”</p>

<p>When she told him the name it was that of his best
friend, the one who was going to be his best man at the
wedding.</p>

<p>Here was a complication.</p>

<p>Now you can see what an apparently harmless dinner
did.</p>

<p>It wasn’t very long ago, so it’s only a step down to
the present day.</p>

<p>The Hungarian gypsy band in a big cafe uptown
was playing its head off, and every table was occupied.
Over in one of the corners—a choice position, by the
way—at a table on which were half a dozen empty
wine bottles, sat two men and a woman. If you will
look at them again you will notice that their faces are
very familiar. Yes, that’s right, it is the pudding girl,
the brewer’s son and the man who was going to be
next to the real one at the big show when two were
made one and the minister was paid double for working
overtime. All three are a bit unsteady, naturally,
for the soldiers on the table tell the story, consequently
they are well primed for a scene of this kind.</p>

<p>The brewer’s son is talking to the other man, and
the girl is playing a listening part, and playing it well.</p>

<p>“You only think you love,” he says, “but all you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
have done is to spend a few hundred dollars—or thousands,
it makes no difference. You’d spend it anyhow
in some other way. I’ve broken off my marriage for
her, and that’s something. You’re a friend of mine
and why don’t you let go?”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, and I agree to what you say. I
haven’t the money I once had, and I don’t think I can
keep the pace up much longer, but I don’t want to see
Maud go up against it. She’s used to nice things. Suppose
the Governor turns on you and cuts you off, what
are you going to do then? You won’t have any more
chance than I have. I know you’re all right now, but
Maud’s got to be taken care of, and if I can do anything
to put her on Easy Street I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>He reached for a half empty bottle and refilled his
glass. He drank slowly and when he had finished he
went on.</p>

<p>“Have you got as much as $10,000?” he asked,
abruptly.</p>

<p>“Easy that.”</p>

<p>“I mean ready money?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ready money.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll tell you what I’ll do. You put $10,000 in
the bank in Maud’s name and I’ll quit, but you also got
to promise me that you will look after her and do
everything for her that she wants. How about that,
Maudie, all right?”</p>

<p>As he spoke he patted her caressingly on the shoulder
while the brewer’s son, flushed to the roots of his hair
with the wine he had drank, dived into an inside pocket
for his check book.</p>

<p>“Will you be the best man, Joe?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
“Best man for what?” the girl spoke for the first
time.</p>

<p>“For our wedding, of course.”</p>

<p>“Not so you can pay any particular attention to it.
You’ll have to chloroform me to get me in front of a
minister. I’m no Sunday-school scholar, and no man
can own me. I believe every woman should be independent,
and when a woman marries she not only sacrifices
her freedom, but herself. I like you both, and
I’m glad to know that I’m worth $10,000 to you,” and
she nodded toward the brewer’s son. “For that I’ll
play fair with you, and if we ever agree to disagree
we’ll do it like two good fellows. Joe, don’t forget to
come around and take dinner with us once in a while,
will you?”</p>

<p>P. S.—A story in a daily newspaper published later
tells about the son of a wealthy brewer committing suicide
by shooting, in his home in a town near New
York. The cause for the rash act is not known.
Strange that it should be the man who was going to
reform, but didn’t, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Take a walk any night along the streets where
women congregate—you know the kind of women I
mean—and study the faces. Look for weakness, and
strength, and character. Look for good and evil.
You don’t have to be a mind reader, just a plain, ordinary,
everyday sort of a man with average intelligence.</p>

<p>If you look for the outward signs of degradation in
the uptown districts you’ll be disappointed; you’ll have
to turn your face and your steps Batteryward to
find that. Vice has a degrading and demoralizing influence
and its victim, in following that unwritten law
of nature that governs the universe, is ever on the
downward path. In some cases it is a gentle descent,
while in others it is simply a series of steps each one
lower than the other, and at the last there is nothing
but pity for the poor devils of women to whom no
man lifts his hat or bows his head, and who cease to
live in merely existing.</p>

<p>And for eight out of every ten there are eight men
somewhere whose hands gave the push that sent
them on the downhill road.</p>

<p>But once in a while—once in a very great while—justice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
comes to a man as it did in this case, and
that’s the story.</p>

<div id="illo_11" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">

  <div class="caption">She had such a superb figure that she once posed for a sculptor</div></div>

<p>Locked up securely in the City Prison like a rat is
locked in a trap, or a dangerous beast is fastened behind
iron bars, is a pretty little black-eyed French
girl.</p>

<p>Julie, her name is, and those who see and talk to
her find in her a great charm; a charm, that had she
been placed in a different atmosphere or had the lines
of her life been cast in different places, would have
been so far-reaching as to make her a power. She
had such a charming figure that she once posed for
a sculptor. Many a woman’s hand has shaped the
course of destiny in this world of ours, and the power
behind the throne usually wears petticoats.</p>

<p>This Julie takes her imprisonment calmly, because
she is a philosopher by force of circumstances. She
knows the metal bars can resist her, consequently she
doesn’t throw herself against them and there are no
tears in her eyes because she can never cry again.
She doesn’t know what they will eventually do to her
and she doesn’t care. If it is decreed that she shall
go forth free, good; then she will go. If it is decreed
that for the rest of her life she shall be doomed
to wear that narrow blue prison stripe, she will at
least be fed and housed and cared for, and on rainy,
stormy days she will be under shelter and not compelled
to walk the streets with dripping skirts until the
gray morning comes over the roof tops.</p>

<p>You see, she has the comforting creed of a fatalist—that
what is to be will be, and that one thought is to
her like a narcotic—she sleeps at nights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
Because of that she doesn’t hear the moans and sobs
of the woman in the next cell, who has the feathery
crime of petit larceny hanging over her head instead
of murder. A mere trifle which means nothing more
than a few weeks—or months at the most—in jail. A
rest like the going away from the hot city streets when
July comes, as the rich people do, or to the South
when winter winds blow. A place where the thermometer
always registers about the same and the meals
come regularly, which is not a thing to be despised by
anyone, much less a woman of the lower half.</p>

<p>If the life of this Julie were to be told year by year
it would take a book of many thousands of pages, and
the pathos, comedy and tragedy would be about evenly
divided. You would have the tale of how she once
asked a man if he had change of a $50 bill. Then
when he pulled out his money she grabbed the roll,
cried out: “Here comes the police,” and dashed into
a hallway in the twinkling of an eye. It was a good
joke and she spent the proceeds for a new dress, for
she was of the kind who make even jokes profitable.</p>

<p>That she was saved from arrest many times was
due to the fact that she stood in with the police, and
she was considered to be one of the most successful
stool pigeons in the business. She was born with
the instinct of the hunter, and hunter she was. In
her own inner circle, however, she was known as The
Slasher, and was feared accordingly.</p>

<p>It came about in this way.</p>

<p>She and another woman of the streets were rivals
in many ways. When they first met they took an
instinctive dislike to each other. The other one was
a blonde, tall and stately—the kind you read about in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
cheap novels. She was an English girl, and when it
came to a knockdown and drag-out argument she was
able to deliver the goods in fine shape. Their first
quarrel was over nothing, and before it was finished
the lady with the golden tresses had taken her French
sister by the shoulders and flung her down an area
bruising her badly.</p>

<p>The Latin blood in the black-eyed one boiled,
and she cried out for revenge, which she proceeded
to work up in a truly Latin manner. She made
friends with her former enemy, said that she was in
the wrong and was sorry for what had happened, and
that she wanted to be forgiven. The blonde fell like
a farmer before Hungry Joe, and they both went off
to celebrate. The celebration consisted in tucking
away many cocktails and highballs, and inside of two
hours the British lady was a sodden wreck, and so
helpless that she had to be carried to her room on
the second floor rear of a house of no reputation.</p>

<p>Julie stayed with her long enough to pull out a
razor and cut three gashes from the bridge of her
nose across one cheek. Then she slipped out and went
on her way as though nothing had ever happened to
give her a moment’s worry.</p>

<p>That little stunt put the blonde out of business, in
that section of the city, at least. It is said she went
further downtown, where there is less of a premium
on beauty and style.</p>

<p>Like other women of her caste Julie found it necessary
to have a protector, and when she first appeared
in the role of hunter she cast about for one who would
suit—one who would fight her battles and upon whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
she could lavish the affection that was not bought, or
that still remained unsold.</p>

<p>Being a good looking girl, educated up to a certain
point, and with pleasant ways—the kind of ways a
man would look for in a girl if he was selecting a
wife—she had no trouble in attaching to herself a
young fellow who was a good mate for her. She let
it be understood at the start that he was to belong to
her and that he was to be at her beck and call. She
wanted to revel in the joys of complete ownership.</p>

<p>He was willing enough, and in fact it rather suited
him, because he came into immediate possession of a
wife, a home and income.</p>

<p>It is to be supposed there was some affection in the
case, for it wasn’t a cold business proposition. It
was bad enough, even from the best side, but she
liked him in a way—you can put the word love in here
if you like—but I am of the opinion that her feeling
was that of a dog-like devotion, and his was one of
knowing a good thing when he saw it.</p>

<p>But she was jealous, too.</p>

<p>“If I see you speaking to any of the other girls,”
she said to him once, “I will leave you right away.”</p>

<p>That was in the early stages, and now notice how a
woman’s affection shifts.</p>

<p>“If you flirt with any of those girls I will kill myself,”
she said six months later.</p>

<p>First she would leave him and then she would kill
herself.</p>

<p>That brings the tragedy to the last stage.</p>

<p>“I will kill you.”</p>

<p>There are no peaceful lives cast in such a groove
as that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
He began to grow a bit tired of her, even though
the money did come to him regularly. You see, he
had no occupation, and he had to do something with
his time, and that something wasn’t good.</p>

<p>Then it was that the quarrels began, a few words
at first, but gradually increasing in bitterness until
one night he came in half drunk and taking her by
the throat almost strangled her. She said afterward
that she thought she was gone, because red lights
danced before her eyes.</p>

<p>But she was game and didn’t whimper, not even
when he struck her in the face with his clinched fist
and threw her to the floor. She took her medicine
gamely, for she realized intuitively that it was her
medicine, and it was a part of the life she was leading.</p>

<p>The strange part of it all was that she never shed a
tear.</p>

<p>Her neck hurt her, and when she looked in the
mirror she saw the marks of his strong fingers and in
that instant she was a changed woman. The flickering
flame of her affection turned to a steady glow of
hate and from that moment she began to figure on
revenge. She stood still and white and cold, and
every tick of the clock on the mantel was a stroke of
doom for him. There was nothing melodramatic
about her at this stage of the game, for her street
training served to make her calm at times.</p>

<p>Woman-like, she at once took up with another
champion and this time she picked out a man who was
peculiarly fitted by force of circumstances to help
her. He was to be not so much a companion as stepping-stone,
and in that she simply followed out the
natural instinct of the average woman who purrs and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
strikes indiscriminately and who makes merchandise
and capital of her favors.</p>

<p>“He beat me,” she told this new one in talking of
the one who had been supplanted, “and I want you
to help me get even.”</p>

<p>The promise was made on this tainted honeymoon
and for one hour every night they went out together
looking for their prey in all of the places where
he had been known to go.</p>

<p>For two weeks it was a fruitless search, and then
the news came to her in an indirect way that he had
been seen in the old haunts.</p>

<p>The good pot-hunter never really hunts—he lures
the game to the decoy—and because she had been years
upon the trail she at once corrected her first mistake
and sent a letter as bait—a tender missive full of
regrets and endearing terms; such a letter as only a
woman could write—a letter like a silken bandage to
blind the eyes and shut out the real view of things.</p>

<p>It came to his hand as she had expected it would,
and when the time arrived he hurried to the rendezvous
to heal the breach and once more place himself on
friendly terms with his income.</p>

<p>There are enough facts in this story to carry it,
but it is not an absolutely correct recital. There are
reasons why it should be changed and so I have
changed it, but not enough to destroy its identity.</p>

<p>On that street at night, with people hurrying to and
fro, they came face to face, but before he could speak
to her, the other man stepped out and seized him.</p>

<p>“Come with me, I want you,” he said roughly, and
he wheeled him around with a deft movement. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
was no other word spoken and only for an instant
was there a brief struggle.</p>

<p>All the while the woman had been fumbling at her
bosom before she drew out a pistol.</p>

<p>Her time had arrived.</p>

<p>She levelled it at the retreating back of the held
man and pulled the trigger. A child couldn’t have
missed a shot like that, and the bullet bored into his
back, throwing him forward slightly.</p>

<p>It had been her intention to shoot but once and
make that one shot do the work, but when she saw
that he was hit the lust of blood came on her and
she pulled the trigger twice more, each bullet finding
its mark, before a policeman ran up and threw one
arm around her neck and with the free hand took hold
of the still smoking weapon. It was the old trick of
the force taught to probationers before they are considered
fit to go forth and guard the public interests.</p>

<p>While her victim was slipping slowly downward
to the pavement she screamed, with as clear an intonation
as if she wanted to be sure it would be a matter
of record:</p>

<p>“And now he will never beat me again.”</p>

<p>Half a dozen men carried the limp dead body into
a store and she was taken there, too, and such was
her ferocity that she tried to kick the corpse of her
quarry.</p>

<p>“He beat me, he beat me,” she shouted, “and now
he will never beat me again. If I had not killed him
he would have killed me.”</p>

<h2 id="hdr_11">THE THROWBACK</h2>
</div>

<p>One of the greatest schools in the world is Little
Old New York, where anyone can learn anything and
anyone can do anything—or do anybody if they should
happen to have but a modicum of brains and native
shrewdness.</p>

<p>It is the haunt as well as the home of the crook;
the respectable trickster; the lady who works and
the lady who doesn’t. The amalgamation of many
races and many creeds has tended to produce cleverness
and wit to a high degree.</p>

<p>One of the greatest of financiers comes from
Russian peasant blood on one side and poverty-stricken
French on the other. In the blood of a Tenderloin
queen there is Irish and Spanish, and it is hard to tell
which side has contributed the most beauty. The combination
of races is the chrysalis—the female product
is the moth.</p>

<p>In the squalid tenements of the East Side there is
beauty in embryo and the figures of Venus are barely
hidden by cheap calico wrappers.</p>

<p>Where the Poles are settled, voluptuous women are
wedded to weak, undersized men, and the result is
either very good or very bad, according to the domination
of the sex. Very beautiful flowers often grow and
bloom in loathsome places, and many a handsome
woman who rides in state along the avenue wouldn’t
care to have her antecedents known to the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
There is such a thing as pre-natal influence, and a
throwback, taking on the good or bad characteristics
of a previous generation, is an accepted fact.</p>

<p>And now we will introduce the lady as she sits in
the courtroom, smiling as though she hadn’t a care or
responsibility in the world. She has the innocent face
of a child and the manner of a cherub, if you know
what that is. If an artist were to paint her portrait in
one of her moments of relaxation he might be justified
if he called it “Innocence.”</p>

<p>“She’s a peach, all right,” remarks a court officer,
and that means a lot when it comes from such a source.</p>

<p>She has the blonde hair and the fair complexion of
the Teuton, and the black eyes of the Slav—a rare
combination, if you’ll take my word for it. She’s coy,
and winning and demure, but with a brain so active
that nothing to her is impossible.</p>

<p>Two generations ago a dashing, handsome young
lieutenant of the German army fell in love with a
sloe-eyed girl who had been born of Slav blood.</p>

<p>He was brilliant but discreditable.</p>

<p>His romances and intrigues were many, and his expenses
were about four times what his income warranted.
One day he forged a check, and when he
skipped over the border to escape arrest he left the
woman and a baby girl in a cheap room with not
enough money to keep them a week. He forgot them
as utterly as if they had never existed, so in the course
of time she who gave up honor added to that her life.</p>

<p>She died in the hospital of a disease that is not mentioned
in the medical books, and the youngster was
shipped to a charitable institution. At the age of nineteen
this waif, orphaned, and stolid of character, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
not even good looks to recommend her, had by dint of
hard work and frugal living, saved up enough money
to take a ship for America, the land of gold, where
fortunes were made by simply wishing for them.</p>

<p>Half way across the sea she came to the notice of an
Irish sailor, and by some strange turn in the inexorable
wheel of fate, they fell in love with each other;
he with his brogue, and she with knowledge of no language
except that of the Fatherland.</p>

<p>Their courtship was over a rugged road, but it came
to a happy conclusion, for before the ship sailed on her
return voyage they were married with the aid of an
obliging minister assisted by a Castle Garden interpreter,
and Connell—that was the sailor’s name—was
looking for a job alongshore.</p>

<p>Two scantily furnished rooms was the best they ever
knew, and in those two rooms the wife who talked
broken English with a Limerick accent died, but not
until she had left a blonde baby girl with the fair complexion
of that dashing lieutenant.</p>

<p>As she grew up, the public school gave her an education,
and when she was old enough she got work in
an office. She was the belle of the ward, and that
old longshoreman father was very proud of her. But
before that she had one little adventure that is really
worth a story by itself, and it shows the kind of a
girl she is. She had a little love affair with a sailor
on one of Uncle Sam’s warships, and when he was
ordered to Cuba she took it into her head to go along.
It was arranged that she was to take the name and
place of a fellow who was about to desert. She came
near getting away with the trick, and as it was she
lasted for ten days before she was found. Then, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
a brief interview with the commanding officer, she
was put ashore when harbor was reached, and enough
money was given her to get back to New York.</p>

<p>It was a clean case of throwback to the army ancestor,
and the resemblance was so great that she might
have been his sister. She held her head high, as became
that one strain of good blood, good enough to
stiffen her pride, but not good enough to shape her
morals, for the taint was there in its full strength.</p>

<p>The elderly business man who employed her began
flirting with her mildly, and he wound up by falling
desperately in love, and so hard was he hit that at the
end of six months she was installed in a handsome
apartment at which he was a constant visitor. He
took the one step that always leads to another, so that
by the time twelve months had been rolled off on the
calendar he had made her home his home, much to
the detriment of his own respected domicile.</p>

<p>So great was the fascination of those black eyes that
this sedate old gentleman forgot he ever had a home
other than the one she was in; a wife, or even children.
She became so necessary to his existence that
she became a part of his life.</p>

<p>She might have walked this primrose path to the
end had he not died. If he had lived there would have
been no need for this story.</p>

<p>When he took that long, last journey her income
came to an abrupt end and she was cast on her own
resources with not even her longshoreman daddy to
stand by and encourage her.</p>

<p>All this, you understand, is not a matter of fancy. It
is, for the most part, court and police records.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
She took up with a young fellow of about her own
age who had about as little prospects as she had, and
with the rent paid for three months in advance and
just enough ready money to keep them going that
long, they cast care to the winds and proceeded to enjoy
themselves. One night, when the funds were getting
to a low ebb, she, while ransacking a desk for a
mislaid letter, found a half-used check-book which had
belonged to her elderly protector.</p>

<p>“I could sign his name better than he could himself,”
she remarked, “and I’ve done it, too.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we could swing one of them now?”
said the man, sitting up straight as the inspiration
came to him.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s absurd; he’s dead.”</p>

<p>“I know he’s dead all right. But fill one out for $75
and I’ll see what I can do with it.”</p>

<p>It was an easy trick for her, and in a moment she
had handed him the paper.</p>

<p>“If I lay this, little girl,” he remarked as he went
out, “we’re on the sunny side of Easy street for the
rest of our lives.”</p>

<p>That heritage of brain stood her in good stead while
he was away, and before he had returned she evolved
a scheme that was worthy of a better cause.</p>

<p>It was this:</p>

<p>She would send him out to rob a letter box; they
would open the mail thus stolen and search it for
checks. She would copy the signature, make note of
the bank, get blank checks of that institution and then
commit the forgery.</p>

<p>It was almost too easy and the keynote of its success
lay in its simplicity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
Of course, the laying of the spurious paper required
nerve, but of what use is a man if he hasn’t nerve?
When he came back unsuccessful, she explained her
scheme, and they at once proceeded to put it in operation.
With wire, to which was fastened an adhesive
mixture, he prepared for the robbery of the mail boxes
while she awaited results.</p>

<p>It has been told time and again how it worked
and they themselves have admitted that their income
rarely fell below $100 a day when they cared to work.</p>

<p>But at the end of every ready-money proposition of
that kind there is a trap. Sometimes the road is very
long and the final tragedy is averted for a considerable
period, but whether long or short it is bound to come
sooner or later.</p>

<p>The girl had grown to be a pastmaster of the art of
forging signatures and success in getting the money
had made the man bold. He began to be less cautious
and the finish came so sure and sudden that it almost
stunned him.</p>

<p>He was cleverly harvested by the police, who at once
set out to get more than enough evidence to convict,
for they looked upon him as the most dangerous of
criminals. A spotter was sent out with instructions
to ingratiate himself with the girl and, if possible, get a
line on just the kind of work that had been done, and
their second interview was very interesting.</p>

<p>“You take Billy’s place for a while,” she said to
him, “and we’ll get enough money to get him out.”</p>

<p>“How?” asked the man.</p>

<p>“How? Are you stupid? Billy didn’t do anything
but lay the paper. I filled out the checks every time.
Didn’t you know that? It’s all my scheme. Billy only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
helped me and did as I told him. But he’s too nice a
fellow to go up the river for a thing like this.”</p>

<p>It seems strange that with all her astuteness she
should have given her hand away to a comparative
stranger, but you must bear in mind that her side partner
and confederate had been snatched away from her
and she felt the need of some one to whom she could
talk and in whom she could confide.</p>

<p>There is where she made a mistake, but it happened
that it wasn’t a fatal one.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that she gave her hand away and told
all she knew, and in that telling there was enough to
convict her half a dozen times over. But she was
game to the last ditch.</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry,” remarked her supposed confederate
to her one evening, “but I’ll have to arrest you.
<em>I’m</em> an officer, you know.”</p>

<p>“I always ought to be guided by my first impressions,”
she retorted. “I had an idea you were wrong
when I first met you and if I had stuck to that you
would have known nothing.”</p>

<p>“That’s right; but as it is I’ll have to take you down
to headquarters.”</p>

<p>He acted as if it was a job he didn’t relish very
much, and if the truth were told he would have let her
make a getaway of it if he had dared.</p>

<p>In the prison she was popular as soon as she stepped
inside the gates, and there was no one who would believe
that a girl with a face like that would be guilty
of harming anyone, much less being a confirmed and
expert forger.</p>

<p>So the trial was called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
She treated it as a joke, and was by far the most
composed person in the room. Her partner, to his
credit, swore that he was the one who had done all of
the robbing of the mail boxes, and all of the forging of
checks, and he even went so far as to imitate several
signatures, but that was offset by the evidence of the
detective.</p>

<p>It was an easy matter to convict him, and he stood
facing a term in prison.</p>

<p>Her trial was merely a bit of comedy in which she
played the star part, and when the last scene had
dropped she was bowing her thanks to the judge, the
jury, the lawyers and the spectators, and smiling all the
while like a girl with a new doll on Christmas morning.
The red was in her cheeks and there was a look
of roguery in her black eyes, and she sailed out of the
courtroom amid a perfect shower of congratulations.</p>

<p>And it was all for one strain of blood.</p>

<p>Father an Irish stevedore, mother a Slav peasant
whom centuries of oppression had made apathetic,
grandmother also a Slav, and grandfather a German
noble. She had gone back one generation to get that
criminal taint, and she may have gone back further
than that to get the good strain that made the whole
world smile with her when she smiled and turn enemies
into friends.</p>

<p>Jane her name was—plain Jane—but she wasn’t
plain by any means. She was far from that. She
could smoke a cigarette, drink a bottle of wine, and
wear a Paquin gown with grace, and in these three
things a woman has a chance to show what she is
and what she can do. For my part I would consider
them a test, just the same as performing certain
mathematical calculations, and showing a proficiency
in geography are tests in civil service examinations.
There is nothing that gives a woman so much poise
and self-confidence as smoking a cigarette daintily.
It gives her a chance to think, you see, and appear
unconcerned, and it is an ambush behind which she
may hide in time of trouble.</p>

<p>This particular Jane had all the vices and charms
that a young woman who is known to the crowd by
her first name ought to have, or might be supposed to
have. Men who were introduced to her found themselves
calling her Jane inside of the hour, and that
was because of her genius, for there are a lot of women
in this world whose baptismal name no man would
ever dare to use, even though they had been acquainted
for years.</p>

<p>There is just as much difference in women as there
is in drinks. It isn’t necessary to go into details on
that subject, for every good hard drinker knows the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
different sensations of the different brands the morning
after.</p>

<div id="illo_13" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">

  <div class="caption">For three solid hours he sat there trussed up like a chicken</div></div>

<p>Jane blew into the big-city with a West wind, a
dress suit case, on one end of which were the initials
of her right name, and the drummer of a wholesale
lace house who had caught her eye and won her regard
by giving her some of his samples.</p>

<p>Your attention is called to the fact that a drummer’s
existence is a cinch, especially if he has samples
that he can afford to give away.</p>

<p>This one had a mustache that curled at the ends, a
bank roll that looked like a toy balloon into which a
kid had stuck a pin—which was Jane’s fault—and a
nerve which was a little bit harder than Harveyized
steel. He used the nerve in his business, and besides,
it came in handy so far as Jane was concerned because
he had a wife in Harlem. He planted Jane in a furnished
flat, where he paid the rent for two weeks.
Then because he had a champagne taste and a beer
purse, he went to a pal of his who was a stage manager
on Broadway and got the lady a job carrying
a spear and wearing pale pink tights in a spectacular
show that was about to be produced.</p>

<p>He was sitting in her front room warming his
shins at the steam heat when he broke the news to her,
and this is the way he did it. You sports can take a
tip from this so you can see how it is done, for no
man can ever foretell when he will be called on to
produce the same line of talk.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” he began, “that you are the best
fellow in the world and that the more I see of you
the more I like you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
“Do you?” asked Jane, simply, for she was nothing
more nor less than a country girl. “I am very
glad of that, but you know the rent was due yesterday
and it hasn’t been paid yet.”</p>

<p>“Now,” he went on, ignoring the touch, “I know
you well enough to know that you would like to be
independent and make your own way in the world. I
want to see you where you will be in a position to
support yourself, and so I have arranged with a man
who is under obligations to me to give you a chance
and put you in the chorus of the ‘Ice King.’ You’ll
get $15 a week at the start and then you’ll be jumped
to $18. After that it’s up to you whether or not you
come to the front and get the real good money with
the yellowbacks.”</p>

<p>“But I have never been on the stage,” she said.</p>

<p>“Don’t I know that, and haven’t I fixed it? You’ll
be broken in all right and all you have to do is as you
are told and you’ll get your money every Monday
night.”</p>

<p>So it was that the girl from Peapack, N. J., became
independent and self-supporting, and was able before
long to send a hundred-dollar note to the folks at
home, for whom she still had a deep regard. You
see, it is only the girls who save their money who can
do that sort of thing.</p>

<p>When the young fellows around town wanted to
see a show, some one would suggest that they go up
and see Jane, and although she hadn’t a line to speak
nor a note to sing, they would line up in the front
row as if she was a star. It didn’t take the manager
of the show very long to find out that Jane could draw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
like a porous plaster and then he jumped her salary
up to $25.</p>

<p>With that she went to a fashionable hair dresser
and paid $200 to have her hair turned from chestnut
blonde to a hue of a stick of pale molasses taffy, the
kind you get for five cents a throw, which sticks in
your teeth and plays the deuce with the filling.</p>

<p>Girls of Jane’s kind are like boxers, in that their
prosperity is manifested outwardly without delay. The
aspiring young knuckle-duster, as soon as he wins a
prominent battle, will at once hie himself off and
blow in a chunk of the purse on a silk hat, patent
leather shoes, a frock coat and a cane. With the
balance he will annex a diamond, then he immediately
becomes the real thing.</p>

<p>A girl has no use for frock coats and canes, but she
goes strong on hair, so her loose coin goes for a
gallon of bleach strong enough to change the faith of
a Hindoo fakir, and that is the strongest thing in the
world, except, perhaps, an African after a hard day’s
work in the slaughter house.</p>

<p>She had a flat on Central Park, South—that’s
wrong, it was an apartment, because she paid over
$1,000 a year for it, whereas flats only cost about $40
a month-and she entertained the bunch with cozy
little wine dinners that would make a man leave his
happy home in a minute.</p>

<p>She was still getting her $25 a week, you know.</p>

<p>Then she tore the drummer’s name out of her address
book, for he was a back number who had shown
a decided tendency to cold feet.</p>

<p>She described him to the butler, and said that if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
ever put in an appearance he was to be dismissed
with the single word:</p>

<p>“Skiddoo.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” said the butler, whose previous
job had been on Fifth avenue. “What does
Skiddoo mean?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t make any difference whether you understand
or not, just you say it to him and he will know,
and that’s enough.”</p>

<p>And all that night this cheese sandwich with the
side whiskers kept repeating the word to himself so
he wouldn’t forget it, and he wrote it down on his
cuff. He also traced it out on a card that he stuck
in behind the hat rack in the hall. In his heart and
soul he thought it was some foreign word which
meant that the lady wasn’t at home or didn’t care to
be disturbed.</p>

<p>That’s the worst of being a butler instead of Chuck
Connors.</p>

<p>The traveling man with the immaculate gall had
reached the worrying stage because the girl was doing
so well and he had been pushed off the track.
If she had stuck to her little furnished flat and the
cheap togs he would have gone on his way whistling
a merry tune, just as all men do. But she was on
the high wave and sipping the cream off the top, and
he thought there ought to be an armchair waiting
for him by the fireplace of her new ranch, which was
very natural, for all men are cast in the same identical
mould. They don’t care for what they have, and are
always hunting for something that’s hard to get.</p>

<p>If you look like the goods you’ll have them all going,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
but as soon as you tell your hard luck story you’ll
get the sandbag where it will do the most good.</p>

<p>One night, after the show, Jane and a bunch of the
merry-merry with money to spend, or burn, or throw
away, was in the front room playing dollar limit poker,
when the drummer, with a choice collection of high
balls stowed away under his vest, and in a fit condition
to either fight or cry, came up in the elevator.
He had overdrawn his salary and was prepared to
buy wine, if necessary, and he was dressed like a man
whose credit is good at the best clothing store in
town.</p>

<p>He held his thumb against the electric button for a
moment, and because the butler was busy with a
sauterne cup, very choice, being of the Barton and
Guestier vintage of ’84, the kind Smithy always orders
when he wants to be real flossy, the maid turned the
knob and came face to face with him.</p>

<p>He made his little spiel, shoved in and stood in the
hall on one foot waiting for the glad hand and the
happy cry that he felt sure was coming.</p>

<p>“What’s his name? Who is he? Why don’t you get
his card?” he heard Jane say. Then the maid came
back.</p>

<p>“Will you please give me your card?”</p>

<p>“That won’t be necessary,” he remarked airily.
“Just tell her Harry is here and she will know.”</p>

<p>He heard the maid telling her little story and then
Jane’s silver tones floated out to him.</p>

<p>“What, that lobster? How did he get in? He
must have had a shoe horn, and I suppose it will take
a load of dynamite to get him out.” Then something
else and all the girls laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
He pulled himself together and walked to where
the voice came from.</p>

<p>The heat of the room was beginning to affect the
cargo he was carrying and he hit both sides of the
wall about eight times before he got to the door. He
pulled the curtains aside and looked in on the game.</p>

<p>“Just thought I’d call,” he said, grinning.</p>

<p>“Well, didn’t I always tell you that you had bad
thoughts?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Thought you’d be glad to see me,” he went on.</p>

<p>“Still thinking?” she queried. “I’ll see that raise
and raise you back ten more.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind taking a hand if you’ll play fair.”
Just then the butler came in with the drinks.</p>

<p>“Henderson,” remarked Jane without even so much
as looking up, “what was that word I taught you—do
you remember it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Well, what was it?”</p>

<p>“Skid-doo, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Very good. Now turn around and say it to that
man.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>He turned slowly and with great dignity to the
drummer who was bracing himself up against the door,
and commanded:</p>

<p>“Skid-doo, sir.”</p>

<p>“So <em>I’m</em> to be fired, eh?”</p>

<p>“Say it again, James; it may be some minutes before
it takes effect.”</p>

<p>“Skid-doo, sir.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I don’t go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
There was no answer to that, but Jane hadn’t been
in New York a whole year without being on to her
job, and she was able to face any proposition that
ever came over the hills.</p>

<p>“Get me a piece of rope, James.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” and away he went, just a bit faster
than usual, wondering, no doubt, what the eccentric
and erratic mistress of his was going to do next. He
got the rope all right and returned with it in short
order, because this seemed to be a case where haste
was necessary, even at the expense of dignity. She
took it from him and walking over to the drummer,
said, as she deftly passed it around him.</p>

<p>“You had me on a string once, Harry, and now
I’m going to get you on a rope.”</p>

<p>“Stop your kidding and be nice, Jane,” he spoke
up, trying to look upon the whole thing as a joke,
but while he was expostulating she had knotted the
rope around both his arms and signalled to the butler
to help her. “I want him tied over there,” she said,
pointing to the piano, and before he knew it he was
seated on the floor with his back up against a slab of
mahogany, being held by the servant while Jane was
making knots like a sailor.</p>

<p>When the job was done the game was resumed
and nobody in the room paid the slightest bit of attention
to him. He threatened and begged and finally
he swore, and then Jane poured a glass of ice water
over his head to cool him off.</p>

<p>“I always thought you had a mean disposition,”
she remarked, “and now I know it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you wouldn’t be here if it hadn’t been for
me,” he shouted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
“No, nor you wouldn’t be there if it hadn’t been for
me,” she retorted.</p>

<p>For three solid hours he was kept trussed up like
a fowl ready for the oven, and at the end of that
time the game came to an end.</p>

<p>“I’m going to bed now,” said Jane, “and in half
an hour the butler will come in and untie you. He
will help you to your feet and when he says skiddoo
to you I hope you will understand what he means.
Good night.”</p>

<p>For thirty minutes the clock ticked monotonously
and the back of the man on the floor was beginning
to ache horribly. At last the silvery chime announced
the half hour and then Henderson stepped softly in.</p>

<p>One by one he untied the fastenings and it was a
tough job in view of the fact that a woman had made
them. After that he helped the visitor to his feet.
He assisted him on with his coat, handed him his
hat, and together they walked, without either saying
a word, to the hall door. The butler swung it solemnly
open, slowly waved his hand, bowed deeply
from the hips and said:</p>

<p>“Skid-doo, sir.”</p>

<p>“Go to hell,” came back the answer, as Harry shot
down the stairs.</p>

<p>“How did he take it?” asked Jane the next morning.</p>

<p>“He took it all right, ma’am, but he was very uncivil,
ma’am.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_13">THE WHIMS OF CURVES</h2>
</div>

<p>The fellows who buy wine and eat terrapin at their
midnight lunches—I ought to say dinners—had found
a new attraction, and for a brief while she was the
idol of the hour. But the trouble with these idols
is that they don’t last, and the finish as a rule is very
disheartening, and in many cases pathetic.</p>

<p>Of course, every once in a while a wise one will
come to the front who will do a little bookkeeping with
herself, and when the smoke of battle will have cleared
away she finds she has enough to tell everybody to go
to blazes if she cares to be rude.</p>

<p>But that is the exception rather than the rule. Quick
money, you know, is like a dream, in that it only lasts
while you are asleep. You think you are in a mansion,
and when the knock comes on the door you discover
that you are in the same old hall bedroom, and realize
that you have to get up just as you have been doing
all your life, and work ten hours a day—or eight, as
the case may be—in order to get enough money to pay
what you owe.</p>

<p>The girl that all the bloods were buying dinners and
flowers for came from the West not so very long ago,
and she didn’t leave any of her good looks behind her,
either. She hit the town with a dress suit case, a
good complexion and a taking way with the boys, and
that’s all the capital any skirt wearer needs in Gotham
if she is only introduced to the right crowd of spenders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
and keeps away from the pikers who have their bank
rolls lashed to the mast or bottled up so tight that when
they do release a bill it smells like an Egyptian mummy
which has been packed in a vault since the time of
Pharaoh.</p>

<div id="illo_14" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img src="images/i_128.jpg" width="439" height="635" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">She put herself up at auction and was promptly bid on</div></div>

<p>This lady hit the trail which led to the show houses.
She had no idea that she was an Adelina Patti or a
Sarah Bernhardt, but she knew she could carry a
spear as good as any old-timer, and she was prepared
to make good.</p>

<p>“Got a job for me?” she asked the first stage manager
she happened to run across.</p>

<p>He looked her over and then remarked casually:</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, for all the star parts are given out
for the season, but you might go over and see Frohman
and ask him if you can’t understudy Maude
Adams.”</p>

<p>“Don’t strain your voice on my account,” she said,
by way of a come-back. “I’m looking for about $18 a
week in the line-up, and when it comes to tights, I
guess there ain’t any of them who has anything on me.
You had me flagged for a Sis Hopkins, but you want
to throw some sand on the track because you’re sliding.
I don’t sit up at night reading Romeo and Juliet,
and where I come from they think Shakespeare is a
new kind of breakfast food. Can you get busy now?”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll have to if I want to get rid of you.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re learning, and that’s a good sign.”</p>

<p>So after he had looked her over again very carefully,
he concluded she’d do for the chorus for a starter anyhow.</p>

<p>A stage manager who is used to hiring ladies whose
talents lie in their legs has a system of his own in picking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
out good ones that don’t need padding, and he
never makes a mistake any more than a red squirrel
will stow away a bad nut for the winter. Face, neck,
hands and arms tell the story and they never fail, and
so he knew she could wear the usual size, and if anything
stretch them a bit.</p>

<p>That was the beginning.</p>

<p>One night four young men about town sat in a theatre
box watching the merry maidens tropping on and
telling in song how happy they were that the Princess
was going to be married to the poor but handsome
gink whose father had a cobbler’s shop one block from
the palace.</p>

<p>“Get onto the curves of the girl with the black hair,”
said one, and in a minute there were four pairs of eyes
looking at one pair of silk tights.</p>

<p>“Great,” said another, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“Who is she?” asked a third. “I never saw her
before.”</p>

<p>“Well, Ben certainly has an eye for beauty. I wonder
where he gets them? Let’s see him and ask him
to put us on, for she’s all right.”</p>

<p>Incidentally, Ben was the first name of the stage
manager.</p>

<p>It isn’t necessary to go into details, for general results
save a lot of time, but a couple of hours later four
enthusiastic young fellows and a dimpled brunette sat
at a round table in a sporty cafe, and when any of them
wanted to address her they called her Curves.</p>

<p>“What are you trying to do?” she asked, when it was
first sprung, “give me a nickname?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the answer, “simply a trademark.”</p>

<p>And they all understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
So because of that she began her career with the
world by the tail on a downhill pull.</p>

<p>Not to know Curves and have her call you by your
first name when you met was to be the deadest kind
of a dead one, and the witty stories she could tell over
a quart of wine soon began to be circulated around
town.</p>

<p>As is often the case, women were her enemies and
men were her friends, and she slid along in a happy-go-lucky
way, letting the morrow take care of itself.</p>

<p>There was no question but that her figure was the
making of her, just as Jennie Joyce’s legs made her
famous from one end of the country to the other when
she was a reigning favorite at Koster &amp; Bial’s old
place on Twenty-third street two decades ago.</p>

<p>The photographer who secured some good poses of
Curves in tights found himself busy printing them to
supply the demand, and it was as easy to get her before
a camera as it was to get a kid to a candy store. If
she had received a dollar for every time she wrote
across the bottom of one of her photographs “Sincerely
yours, Curves,” she would have had a bank account
that would have been broad, wide and deep. But she
was simply a good fellow and she made no attempt to
live by her wits. Like many another poor devil, she
probably thought she would always be young, good-looking
and popular. She didn’t know that those whom
the public applauds to-day it kills to-morrow, and that
it takes but a week in New York to make a favorite
less than a memory.</p>

<p>But there was one incident in her career that stands
out in relief from anything of the kind that anyone
had ever done before, and it is worth telling. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
characteristic of her to do a thing of this sort, and she
was the one woman in a hundred who could have got
away with it.</p>

<p>A soulful-eyed, chocolate-skinned Brahmin priest
had come to town to spread his faith, and because
he talked in an exceedingly entertaining manner and
told some curious and interesting stories he came to be
a fad. It wasn’t that the people who went to see and
hear him were interested in his religion, but it was because
he was a novelty that he filled his lecture room
every afternoon. Two men and Curves dropped in
one afternoon at a time when this spreader of a new
creed was telling about the money it would cost to do
good in the world, and on that subject he was particularly
eloquent.</p>

<p>“You Americans,” he said, “don’t know what it is
to make a sacrifice; you don’t know what it is to deny
yourselves any of the good things of life. Your men
would not forego their cigars or wine even if the spiritual
salvation of the world depended upon it, and your
women would not permit themselves one particle of
physical discomfort nor cheaper wearing apparel even
though a hundred souls were the price. The whole
world is selfish and wrapped up in itself, and religion
is either a fad or a jest. The man with a million gives
a few thousands and thinks he has done well, but he
denies himself nothing. The woman with a check
book doles out dimes and fancies herself a philanthropist,
but will she make any sacrifice for the general
good?”</p>

<p>“Here’s one who will.”</p>

<p>Two-thirds of the people in the room turned around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
and looked at Curves, and one of the fellows with her
took her arm and whispered:</p>

<p>“What is the matter, are you dotty?”</p>

<p>The ox-like eyes of the religious enthusiast seemed
to blaze up a bit.</p>

<p>“You will make a sacrifice?” he asked. “What can
you give?”</p>

<p>“I’ll give myself,” she answered, and she stood up
defiantly.</p>

<p>People who tell this story, as well as a few who
were there, say that Curves had a most elegant tide on
at the time and didn’t know what she was saying, but
that doesn’t alter the story, because this is simply a
recital of facts which can be verified by a whole lot
of the fellows, and the sequel can be found on record
among the marriages in the Bureau of Vital Statistics
by anyone who is interested enough to look it up.</p>

<p>“It is very praiseworthy,” continued the priest, “but
how do you propose to put your gift to a practical
use? You say you will give yourself. Do you mean
by that that you will devote your time to this work
which I am trying to carry on?”</p>

<p>“Not that way so you can notice it, but I have a lot
of men friends here and each one of them has asked
me to marry him more than once. I like them all and
as marriage is a lottery anyhow, they can bid for me,
and you get the money.”</p>

<p>As she spoke she was climbing up on the table in
the center of the room. “I am ready for the first offer
and I don’t care who makes it, for I’m taking as many
chances as anybody else.”</p>

<p>Now here was a situation that reads like a romance,
and here was the one in a thousand to get away with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
it. The women were shocked, of course; the men were
interested, and as for the priest he didn’t know whether
to take it seriously or not, until finally what might have
been an awkward situation was relieved by a man who
said:</p>

<p>“Well, if she’s game enough to have herself auctioned
off, I’m game enough to make a bid, so I’ll say
$500, with the proviso that the cause of religion, which
our revered friend represents, shall get half, the other
half to go to the lady who shows such a praiseworthy
spirit.”</p>

<p>Then three gaunt females over forty arose in the
majesty of their outraged womanhood and stalked
from the room, while a dozen others moved uneasily
in their seats.</p>

<p>The Brahmin was still figuring.</p>

<p>“Am I worth no more than $500?” put in Curves.</p>

<p>“I’ll make it $750,” said one of the men who had accompanied
her.</p>

<p>“You paid twice as much for a horse last week,
Billy,” she retorted.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think of that. Let it go at $1,500, for
there’s going to be competition.”</p>

<p>The priest’s hand was nervously fingering a silk
handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Two thousand,” the first bidder’s voice came like a
bullet from a gun, and Billy laughed nervously.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Billy, it’s up to you again,” and Curves
nodded at him encouragingly.</p>

<p>“She’s worth it, Bill,” whispered his friend. “Your
Panhard cost you $11,000 and it takes $100 a week to
keep it going. Curves can be very economical when
she tries,” and he laughed at his joke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
“Twenty-five hundred,” bid Billy.</p>

<p>“Sold,” cried Curves, “although <em>I’m</em> worth more.”</p>

<p>“Very extraordinary,” said the priest, wiping his
forehead with his handkerchief. “This could happen
in no other country in the world.”</p>

<p>“Write him a check, Billy, for what you owe him,”
said Curves, “and then we’ll go out and get married.
And don’t you think it would be nice to have him to
dinner with us?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing, and we’ll have the other fellow who bid
along, too. By the way, who is he? I don’t ever
remember to have seen him before. Do you know him?”</p>

<p>Now what a chance here for a climax, for a real
whipping finish, as it were. It might be arranged so
that the girl would say sadly:</p>

<p>“Yes, he holds the mortgage on the farm and has
threatened to foreclose it if I don’t marry him. Oh,
Billy, you must save me.”</p>

<p>Then Billy would pull out his check book, pay the
villain off to the penny and the man would go tearing
out of the door shouting:</p>

<p>“Foiled again, c-u-u-rses on you, but I’ll have revenge,”
with the accent on revenge.</p>

<p>But no such thing happened, because you see Curves
never had an interest in a farm, and it is very much to
be doubted if she knew anything about a father or
mother. The result was that she said:</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose he’s some guy that’s been to the show
and got stuck on my shape.”</p>

<p>The honeymoon lasted six months, which was
enough for Billy, and he beat it to New Orleans, while
his friends told Curves that they thought he had committed
suicide.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_14">CHEYENNE NELL; TRIMMER</h2>
</div>

<p>The gambler in this story came from the West to
get a little New York money. He had been getting
it for years from the Sierra Nevadas to El Paso, and
from Seattle as far east as Omaha, which he said was
far enough for anybody who liked fresh air, but he had
struck a run of bad luck and one of his pals told him
that the best way to break it was to trim a New York
sucker.</p>

<p>“They’re fly guys there all right,” remarked this
same man, casually, “but the flyer they are the easier
it is to trim them. I would sooner stack up against
a stock broker that runs one of those bubble machines
and can speak sixteen different languages than get
into a game with a Kansas farmer any day. The
farmer knows he ain’t in it and he’s got his eye out for
a job every time; his coat is buttoned up so tight that
he has contraction of the lungs and his heart doesn’t
beat right, but the gink that knows it all thinks he’s
so damned smart that he’s got everybody in the world
in his corral, and those are the fellows you catch with
their vests open.”</p>

<p>All homely philosophy, but as true as gospel and
worth looking into.</p>

<p>So Big Ben—that was his name in the country
where slouch hats are the real thing—pulled his
freight one night and hit the Overland Flyer for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
Gotham. His name was Big Ben no longer, for the
cards he carried in his vest pocket read:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benjamin F. Van Buren, Mining Engineer.</span></p>

<p>He bought tickets for two at the station, and there
is the heart of the story, as one of the tickets was
for Cheyenne Nellie.</p>

<p>The lady in the case is worth a paragraph at the
very least, for she had the reputation of being the best
short-card dealer in Texas, and at a game of bank,
whether playing the cards or handling the box, she
was there with the goods and never asked any odds on
account of her sex.</p>

<p>She had the long, slim hands of a card player, and
if she hadn’t taken to the pasteboards she might have
been a piano player and getting all kinds of money
for hitting up the ivories at swell concerts. She was
soft of voice and soft in manner, and all you had to
do to make a lady out of her was to wrap her in a
silk robe and she’d make the horses in the street
turn around and look after her.</p>

<p>On one memorable occasion she went into the smoking
car of a Denver train and calmly lighting a cigarette,
smoked it without deigning to notice the men
around her.</p>

<p>The trip was settled in a minute and in this way.</p>

<p>“It’s a long ride, Nell,” observed Ben, “to the
place I’m going, and I’m afraid I’ll get lost or lonely,
so if you’ll come along with me I’ll tog you out like
a queen and give you the time of your life. Will
you carry my brand for the trip?”</p>

<p>“How big is your bank roll?” she asked, with an
eye to the practical side of the proposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
“Twenty-seven hundred, and two thousand to draw
on if I lose out.”</p>

<p>“That’s enough for a starter. What are you going
to do—short-card ’em or bank ’em?”</p>

<p>“Anything and everything including stud, and if I
get the big bundle we’ll hike for that place across
the big pond where the real games are. What’s the
name of it—I forget now. I had it written down
somewhere, but I guess I’ve lost it. It begins with
an M I think, and there was a fellow at the show the
other night who had it in his song about how he
broke the bank there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean Monte Carlo.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it. We’ll go there and I’ll put you up
against the game, for you always were hell when it
came to a no-limit play.”</p>

<p>One night stop-over in Chicago to see a show, and
then, twenty-four hours later, Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin
F. Van Buren, of Portland, Oregon, registered
at the Waldorf-Astoria.</p>

<p>“Kind of like a theatre, ain’t it?” remarked Ben,
as they sat in the palm room after dinner. “Looks
like Romeo and Juliet where the gal is on the gallery
and the fellow with the skin-tight pants is asking her
to come down and talk it over.”</p>

<p>Men who are supposed to know say that New York
is the loneliest place in the world, that is, if you don’t
know anyone, and that a desert island is a center of
population compared to it if you are not in right. On
the face of it that looks like a good argument, but it
is going to be disproved right here. Go to a big and
fashionable hotel and register, then sit around and
be a bit conspicuous, look like ready money, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
above all, easy money, and you’ll draw people like a
Jack rose draws bees. They’ll find you out just as
easily as the ferret gets to the timid rabbit—by going
after you—and unless your heart is covered with callous
spots and your pockets are fastened with safety
pins, when you come to count up at night you’ll find
you are short a bit of change. In this world, you
know, things are not always what they seem, and the
fellow who looks the wisest and talks the loudest isn’t
the smartest any more than the man with the retreating
forehead is the stupidest. The one with the cranium
of a cocoanut may have spent all of his life developing
the instinct of the hunter and the cunning
of the fox, and that queer-shaped thing on top of
his shoulders is the sign which he has hung out and
which says as plainly as if the words were printed
on his forehead: “Come on, boys, I’m easy; come
and get my change.” I know all about this and speak
from experience, for I used to sit in a poker game
with a Dutchman who looked like a pinhead, and
when the rest of us walked home he used to take a
cab, because he had all the money, and his name was
Schneider, too. What do you think of that?</p>

<p>So before a week had gone by, Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin
F. Van Buren were nodding and saying “How
do you do?” and “Good morning” and “Good evening”
to about twenty or thirty men who made the
hotel their headquarters. Incidentally it was given
out that Ben was on here to buy some machinery
for one of his mines in Nevada and that he wouldn’t
mind having a little fun with anything that came
along so long as the stakes were not too big for a
man of his modest disposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
The tip went down the line in the usual channels
and then one rainy night a man who said confidentially
that he was a banker suggested that as there was
nothing else to do Mr. Van Buren could, if he felt
so disposed, walk around to his hotel where there
were two or three other good fellows, and they might
have a little game of draw.</p>

<p>“None of us want to go into big money, you know,”
he said, apologetically, “for it’s simply a game among
friends and it’s about as good a way to pass the time
away as I know of. We don’t, as a rule, play with
strangers, but I guess you’re all right, so come along.”</p>

<p>“Look out for a cold deck, Ben,” whispered Nell as
he started; “play light and close to your skin at the
go-off, and it won’t hurt to lose a little at the start.”</p>

<p>Wherever you go or whatever you do in this world,
always take a woman’s tip—not the tip of every woman
of course, but when you find one who delivers the
goods at every jump out of the box and calls the turn
on the case card nine times out of every ten, then be
wise and attune your ears to her siren song, even
though the notes seem to be a bit cracked at first and
the cadenzas strike you as being skewed and off the
key.</p>

<p>There were five in the game, counting Ben, and up
against the wall, like a new kind of decoration, was a
Senegambian, whose business it was to see that the
gentlemen had cigars to smoke and wine to drink
without limit. Between deals they talked about business,
how stocks were selling, what chance there was
for a flyer in Steel, and if Depew intended to resign
from the Senate or not. The play was light and reckless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
and no one there seemed to care whether he won
or lost.</p>

<p>“We play two or three times a week,” explained
one to Ben, while the African was getting a fresh
pack, “and I consider poker the greatest thing in the
world to take a man’s mind off his business. Is there
any stock in your mine for sale? I wouldn’t mind
taking a block if it looked right. So this is your first
visit here? Well, we’ll try and make it pleasant for
you while you stay, but you must reciprocate if we ever
hit your country. Will you show us some shooting?”</p>

<p>It went that way until Ben got to feeling a little
easy in his play himself. But he couldn’t lose. Everything
came his way, including jackpots, and when
the silvery chimes of the clock on the mantel reminded
them that it was one o’clock the play came to
an end and the man from the West cashed in a matter
of $72.</p>

<p>“It was only a friendly game, Nell,” he said, when
he woke her up from a sound sleep half an hour
later. “They are simply a lot of good fellows and
I couldn’t help winning, but they want revenge to-morrow
night and then I’ll get some real money.”</p>

<p>“Three thousand miles is a good long walk, Ben,”
she said, “and that’s a little tune you want to keep
humming to yourself all the time. The easy marks at
cards all died during the time of the big wind and
only the fly guys are left. You’re in a strange barn this
trip, so don’t think that everything you see is hay.”</p>

<p>From playing three nights a week they got down to
playing every night, and Ben always came back with
a small winning, but he wasn’t getting the money
he was after and it got on his nerves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
“It’s only chicken feed <em>I’m</em> winning,” he complained
to her one night, “and it just about pays expenses.”</p>

<p>“Well, just you keep your shirt on, for I’m in with
some nice old dames who think they are the real ones
at bridge, and I’m thinking of getting a little of that
same kind of feed myself—the real killing will come
later. You never want to be in a hurry about those
things, you know, because if you hurry them it’s all
off. Get those fellows to play up in the room some
night so I can look them over and see their style.”</p>

<p>“I’m next to their play all right,” he said, “They’ll
stand to lose so much and no more and there ain’t one
of them who would bet a thousand that he was alive.”</p>

<p>“Invite them up, anyway. You’ve been drinking
their booze and smoking their good cigars long
enough. You ought to put up for them once in a
while, and if they are all right you will have a few
decent friends, anyhow.”</p>

<p>That’s how it happened that the play came off in
No. 723.</p>

<p>It was the smallest kind of a small and inoffensive
game, unmarked by any incident or episode until one of
the men, looking his hand over with unusual care, remarked
in the most casual manner possible:</p>

<p>“If I had the nerve I have a hand here that I would
like to bet big on.”</p>

<p>“How big?” asked Ben, taking another look at the
cards that had been dealt to him.</p>

<p>“I don’t know much about poker, but I think a
thousand would be about right to start with.”</p>

<p>“Mine looks worth that much to me,” said Ben,
with his face like a mask.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
“I’m game; does a check go?”</p>

<p>Over in one corner of the room, with a novel before
her, sat Nell. She was almost directly opposite Ben,
and as he looked up he saw the upper lid of her left
eye droop slowly, recover, and then droop again. He
skinned his cards and looked them carefully over. The
pips showed four kings and an ace, pat. It was worth
big money in any four-handed game, and he knew it.</p>

<p>“Does a check go?” came the query again.</p>

<p>“No, I weaken; I thought I had a better hand.
You’ve got me beat from the start.”</p>

<p>It might be made a long story from this point on,
but there is not room here to tell in detail how half
an hour later Nell rose from her comfortable seat in
the armchair in the corner, and walking over to the
table manifested a slight interest in the game, and
after one or two more hands had been dealt, thought
she would like to play if the gentlemen didn’t object,
which they didn’t. How she played like any woman
would be expected to play, losing angrily and winning
sweetly, until on one of her deals, Ben found
himself in possession of a hand which only needed the
ace to make a royal flush. The limit was raised before
the draw, then taken off altogether, and the
money began to pile itself on the mahogany. Then
they drew for cards, and when Ben looked things
over he found in his one card draw the ace that made
his hand good.</p>

<p>“Mine is worth $500,” remarked the player opposite
him.</p>

<p>“I’ll kiss mine good-bye,” said Nell, as she dropped
her pasteboards in the discard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
“Raise you $500,” put in Ben, looking at the first
bettor.</p>

<p>“Five hundred more,” was the third man’s bid.</p>

<p>“It’s too hot for me,” was the comment of the
fourth, as he pushed his cards away from him.</p>

<p>It was raised in jumps of $500 until there was
about $11,000 up, and Ben had been boosting every
raise as fast as it came to him.</p>

<p>Then the call was made and the show-down was
worth going miles to see, for the battle at the finish
had narrowed down to Ben and one other.</p>

<p>“Take a check for the next bet?” asked the other.</p>

<p>“No,” came the terse answer.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll have to call you. But I’ve got you
beaten!”</p>

<p>For answer Ben spread out his invincibles.</p>

<p>For a moment the silence was painful.</p>

<p>“Are they good?” asked Ben.</p>

<p>“You know damned well they are,” came the answer.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Benjamin Van Buren, mining engineer,
of Portland, Ore., gathered in the oof in the most
leisurely manner possible.</p>

<p>“Now you can buy me that new hat you promised
me, can’t you, Ben?” said Nellie.</p>

<p>“I sure can buy you a dozen hats now if you want
them.”</p>

<p>Exactly thirty minutes later three men were lined
up against the bar below.</p>

<p>“You can talk from here to the Coast, if you want
to,” said one, “but I tell you the woman did the trick.
Didn’t she deal the cards? I tell you she short-carded
us. She’s a gold mine.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_15">TRAGEDY OF A DANCE</h2>
</div>

<p>It was just a plain unpretentious flat in New York,
the kind that is rented for about $40 a month. You
know the style—four or five rooms and bath and a
narrow little space which is dignified by the name of
private hall, and which is supposed to be the real thing
in living apartments. It was furnished in the way in
which anyone would expect, and an auction sale
wouldn’t net more than $50 for everything that was
there.</p>

<p>In the front room sat a man who wasn’t as old as he
looked, but whose apparent age was caused by ten
hours a day in an attempt to make a living for himself.
For twenty years he had been ground down by fate,
and at the end of it all he had nothing, and he was
in debt to the world for exactly three score of years.</p>

<p>Now at the last mile post he had come face to face
with a tragedy.</p>

<p>In one calloused hand he held a telegram. In the
other was the photograph of a girl—good looking in a
way, saucy, blue-eyed and blonde. It had been taken
in theatrical costume and that told half of the story.
The other half was in the telegram.</p>

<p>He wiped his eyes with the back of his hand and
read again:</p>

<p>“Your daughter died in the hospital here to-day;
please advise as to the disposition of the remains.”</p>

<p>It bore date of a Southern city, and was signed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
the manager of a barn-storming company of show
people.</p>

<p>If you read the newspapers you must have read part
of the story. You will read the rest of it here—the
part that wasn’t told, because an ordinary chorus girl
isn’t of sufficient importance to take up more than a
very little space in the prints, unless, of course, she
does something so violently tragic and sensational that
she rises above the common herd and becomes at
once a figure of almost national importance, like the
young woman who once tried to shoot a senator, or the
one who danced nude before a select company of
young spendthrifts, or the one who made $50,000 in
stocks with the kind assistance of a “gentleman friend.”</p>

<p>Just four months before, the old man’s daughter had
been working in a big dry goods store—a mill that
grinds pretty fine sometimes—and one day she attracted
the attention of a man who was putting a show
out on the Southern tour. He saw talent in her, or at
least he thought he did, but if the truth were to be told
he fell in love with her, and came to the conclusion
that she would make a better traveling companion
than anyone he had seen so far—this season. He had
a code of morals that was iron clad, but wouldn’t stand
investigating. In his eyes they were all cattle, and
like cattle he graded them.</p>

<p>But this isn’t going to be a moral story, because it
is the truth.</p>

<p>If you want morality nowadays you will have to go
to fiction, where the man always marries the girl and
they live happily ever after. It sounds nice and leaves
a sweet taste in the mouth, but it is a long cry from
the truth except in a few rare cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
So here’s the picture, about as commonplace as it
can be made.</p>

<p>A girl with visions of the stage, a dream of a life of
ease and luxury, imagining that some day she will be a
performer of merit; a violent hatred of the unending
routine of the store, and ready at a moment’s notice
to turn her back on the old man in the flat.</p>

<p>Isn’t that the way?</p>

<p>Bring them into the world, care for them and nurse
them. Worry over their little troubles, deny yourself
that they may have more; sacrifice everything for
their happiness, and then at the critical moment when
they might become a comfort instead of a care, presto!
along comes a man with a line of talk that would
make a cat on a back yard fence take to cover, and away
they go, saying good-by if they happen to think of it,
and forgetting that there are such things in the world
as obligation or gratitude.</p>

<p>But this isn’t really what I started to say. You see,
I have a brother who is a minister, and I am under
the impression that he is teaching me bad habits—that
is, if it is a bad habit to sit down and preach about
a lot of things that are wrong when you would probably
do the same things you condemn in others. It’s
a case of don’t do as I do, but do as I say.</p>

<p>It’s a cinch to tell other people to do the right thing,
but it’s another thing to be on the level yourself.</p>

<p>After that little digression I’ll show you this girl on
the road singing choruses with the bunch, and just a
bit swell-headed because she was in a position to call
the manager by his first name. That didn’t help her
with the rest of the crowd any, and they called her
names when they were where she couldn’t hear them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
while at the same time there wasn’t one of them who
wouldn’t have changed places with her in a holy
minute.</p>

<p>She had one or two fights on her hands, but she
always won out.</p>

<p>The manager found out she had a figure that would
have been worth a place in the front row of the merry-merry
of Weber and Fields when that firm was at its
best. Here was a chance that a good, clever, astute
fellow like him couldn’t very well overlook, and he proceeded
to have her taught a few dances of the kind that
are not sanctioned in polite society, or even on the
stage, or which make any pretence to being legitimate.
He was working on the principle that all is
grist that comes to the mill, and he was also looking
ahead.</p>

<p>There are, as a rule, a pretty gay lot of boys in those
Southern towns, and they are not averse to paying a
good bit of money for a show after the show, especially
if it is the kind that is forbidden. If the sensuous
dance of the Nautch girl can be imitated in all of its
windings, twistings and quiverings by a shapely American
girl whose disregard for clothing amounts to almost
contempt—that is, on certain occasions—there is
enough money to make it an object not only for the
performer but the manager.</p>

<p>“I am going to put you up against a proposition that
will make the hit of your life,” was the way he started
it.</p>

<p>“That’s me,” she said; “what is it?”</p>

<p>“Why, do a stunt in the altogether for the sports.”
Then he took a couple of extra puffs at his cigar to
keep his nerve up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
“The altogether—what’s that?”</p>

<p>She had an idea what it was, but she wanted to get
it straight.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all the rage down here—you dance without
much clothes on. All the girls are wild to get some of
the money, but there’s nothing doing with them, for
your figure will make them look like a lot of kippered
herrings that’s been smoked for a week. You see,
we’re in this business for the coin, and we might as
well get it and get it quick. If we don’t there’ll be a
thousand others after it. It’s a case of take it or leave it
and it’s up to you. How about it?”</p>

<p>He stiffened her up so she was willing to make good.
He told her she had enough curves to make the Venus
de Medici look like a barn door, and that she was a
peach with the original bloom on, all of which she
believed because it was pleasant for her to hear, and
was getting a bit stuck on herself. It was a modern
case of showing Eve all over again where the golden
apple grew, and inducing her to reach up and get it.</p>

<p>The first trick was to come off at Memphis, Tenn.,
where a lot of hot sports wanted something so full of
ginger that they would have put ice on the backs of
their necks to keep the temperature down below the
100 mark. A committee of two called on him at the
stage entrance, and after declaring themselves asked
him if he had anybody with the outfit who could make
good. After the preliminary skirmish it settled down
to a question of price, and the matter was soon arranged,
and half an hour later Daddy’s girl got the tip
that she was expected to be on the job when the clock
struck twelve, with a carriage to and from the hotel
as a compliment to her superb figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
No good hardened old pelter would have halted at
this hurdle, and would have gone at it with a keen
relish, but you must know that this was the first season
out for this girl, and when it came to the time that
she was to let go all that kept her from appearing in
the costume that Mother Eve is supposed to have worn
in the Garden of Eden, she promptly lost her nerve.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I can do this thing, Jim,” she remarked
to the manager as they were leaving the
theatre together. “It didn’t seem so bad at first, but
now I don’t quite like the idea of it. I never did anything
like this before, you know.”</p>

<p>“Of course I know,” he answered quickly, “but you
want the money, don’t you? Do you want to be a
piker all your life? Why, you’ll get more for a stunt
like this than you can make in a month doing anything
else. Just think of that.”</p>

<p>He was keen enough to see, however, that she was
inclined to quit at any moment, but there was no proposition
an old seasoned campaigner like him couldn’t
handle, and when they went into the hotel cafe together
he had framed things up to his own satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I’m going to blow you to a bottle of wine to-night,
and while we’re waiting for it we’ll have a cocktail.”</p>

<p>He figured on dulling her sense of morality with
drinks, and he went at it in the most businesslike
manner possible.</p>

<p>Before the wine a cocktail with a cherry, then another
cocktail. Three pints of extra dry, most of
which she lapped up simply because it was champagne
and was expensive, and then she was in a mood that
was at once mellow and reckless.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he said, when the last drop had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
drained. “Come on, the wagon is waiting and if you
make a hit you won’t need to bother about those new
dresses you wanted last week, for here is where you
get next to a real gold mine. Why, there ain’t a girl
in the show that wouldn’t go to the deuce to get this
chance.”</p>

<p>She assented, but through it all she had a hazy idea
that it was wrong and that she ought to back out. But
just think of almost three pints of wine seething and
bubbling inside of her while she is trying to discriminate
between right and wrong. I tell you it’s impossible,
for when the corks pop often enough it’s hell let
loose, and a girl has to protect herself in the breakaway
every time, with the odds against her.</p>

<p>And now, a big room, carpeted, with palms on pedestals
here and there, giving it an air of luxury, and a
platform at one end. Fifty men, young and old, seated
in chairs that were lined up like a regiment were waiting
expectantly. The smoke from many cigars and
cigarettes filled the air, and the monologue man who
was trying to interest them with funny stories knew he
was up against it and that he was only filling in time
until the big show should be ready. He told everything
he knew, but never a smile was cracked, and
when he came to a finish he walked off angrily.</p>

<p>The three musicians began a new tune with mournful
cadences, but with a swing that suggested sinuous
movements. The two violins wailed out the minor
chords, and the piano trailed the bass. Somewhere
from behind came the sharp snap of a man’s fingers
and the lights went down and the theme of the music
was changed.</p>

<p>“The Dance of the Dawn, gentlemen,” came a voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
from out of the darkness and the fifty straightened up
in their seats expectantly.</p>

<p>A shape crept out upon the stage and moved in time
to the music. Then the lights gradually began to go
up a little at a time until at last the face and figure of
the dancer were visible. She was clad in transparent
gauze, with Turkish trousers and a bolero to match,
and her swayings were artistic and graceful. But there
was no reason in them. They were mechanical and
lifeless. She moved by instinct and intuition and the
impression the dance sought to convey was lost. The
manager himself worked the cymbals which punctuated
the finish of each measure, and at the final crash
the stage was once more shrouded in darkness.</p>

<p>Lights up and then the second announcement:</p>

<p>“The Dance of Nature.”</p>

<p>That soothing music was born in the brain of a Calcutta
idealist who knew how to put the tip of his finger
on the pulse of the senses. Three second-rate performers
ground it out, but with all their mediocrity
they couldn’t kill its charm, even though they dulled
it somewhat.</p>

<p>Here was the real thing at last, and fifty pairs of
eyes were glistening in anticipation.</p>

<p>The moment’s wait seemed like an hour, and then a
girl’s voice broke what seemed to be a spell:</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t, Jim, I can’t.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to, it’s too late to back out now.”</p>

<p>“I won’t, I tell you, not for anybody.”</p>

<p>The next instant the nude figure of the girl was
catapulted out upon the platform—a figure which
dropped to its knees and then tumbled over on its face
and lay there in a quivering heap sobbing violently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
A tall man with snow-white mustache rose slowly
from his seat in the second row. He turned around to
face the rest, and then said, as calmly as if he were in
his own house:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, I protest; this must not go on. It is
disgraceful.”</p>

<p>He picked up his hat and coat and started for the
door.</p>

<p>In five minutes the room was empty. The girl had
been pulled back of the scenes by a cursing manager,
but she might as well have been dumb for all she heard.</p>

<p>“You’re a mutt,” he was saying; “here you’ve had
your chance and quit, and you’ve made a sucker out of
me, too. I can’t look any of those people in the face
again.”</p>

<p>Of course, he didn’t consider where she figured.</p>

<p>Then he walked out and left her there with a skirt
wrapped around her as her only covering.</p>

<p>The janitor found her when he came to turn out the
lights.</p>

<p>She was partly dressed then, and shivering. He
helped her finish dressing, and then he went out to
get her a drink to warm her up a bit.</p>

<p>Later she wandered out and got another drink to
make her forget and still another that her mind might
be blank.</p>

<p>At daybreak she was in the hospital in a state of
coma from which nothing could rouse her. She never
came back again, and when the call-boy in the theatre
in the next town was calling out: “Fifteen minutes—first
act,” she died.</p>

<p>Yet his friends say the manager is one of the best
fellows in the business.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_16">THE MONOLOGUE GIRL’S STORY</h2>
</div>

<p>It was after the show that there were four of us
sitting at the round table in the back room of The
Dutchman’s on Third avenue. It’s a pretty good
place, that self-same back room, and the big steins of
beer are pretty good, too, with a heaping plate of
pretzels always on the side and a sandwich to be had
by pressing the button.</p>

<p>There was Al Fostell, the German comedian, who
ought to have been in the legitimate long ago; Harry
Ferguson, famous for his impersonation of <i>Happy
Hooligan</i>; Harry’s wife, Lulu Beeson, the Star of
Texas, and so great a dancer that she has a Richard
K. Fox medal about as long as her arm, which any
beskirted performer can get by beating her at the
soft shoe buck; and one other, whom I shall simply
designate as The Girl, because, even though she plays
a star part in this, she doesn’t want to be known to
the general public.</p>

<p>The Girl was brilliant, versatile and clever. She
took it into her head to become a dancer once, and
among other things she learned the fandango. She
went to Mexico with a troupe and danced that famous
measure in a way that made them cheer her to
the echo. She played faro bank and won enough to
keep her in clothes for a year.</p>

<p>The talk had drifted on marriage and Fostell started
things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
“I have been married a good many years, more than
I care to tell,” he said, “and I have been trying to
induce my daughter to call me uncle so they won’t
get on to me. I claim that a performer’s domestic life
can be just as pure and happy as that of a business
man. I agree that there is a lot of immorality in the
profession, but you’ll always find a lot of outsiders
helping things along. There are times when we seem
to be targets for the whole world to shoot at.”</p>

<p>“In my opinion,” put in Ferguson, “the performers
who are in the business to make a living on their
merits are for the most part decent people whose lives
are an open book. The women of the chorus of the
big shows on Broadway—the kind who haven’t a line
to speak and who couldn’t speak it if they had—are
responsible in the main for all of these sweeping
charges of immorality. Our children are born in the
shadow of the theatre, and a great part of their lives
are spent in the green rooms and dressing rooms. We
try to do the best we can by them and bring them
up properly.”</p>

<p>Then The Girl, who can tell stories and sing in a
most charming way, and who for that reason has a
salary that is worth considering, broke in:</p>

<p>“You men with wives sit back and talk of morality
and all that sort of thing and you don’t know what it
means. You two are lucky because you have married
good women who look after your interests and bring
your children up as best they can under the circumstances.
You only see things from the viewpoint of
the male animal, who is used to being waited on and
catered to. The average man says, ‘I am handsome,’
‘I am great,’ ‘I am distinguished,’ or ‘I am the real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
one,’ as the case may be. He sees a girl whose appearance
catches his fancy and straightway he must
have her. He likes her and that settles it. It makes
no difference whether or not she likes him—her feelings
are not to be considered. He is the one. If his
passion is a strong one he pursues her to the finish
and hounds her. If she still holds out he becomes
actuated by a motive of revenge and so he sets out to
try to injure her, to prevent her from making a living
that she may feel the pinch of poverty. He uses all
the influence at his command to crush and humiliate
her, and then he taunts her.</p>

<p>“Boys, I’ve been through the mill and I know what
I’m talking about. I’m a kid no longer, and I wouldn’t
marry the best man on earth, nor tie myself up to him
for either a definite or an indefinite length of time.
No double acts for me, but monologues from now on
until I get my 23.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you something you never heard before.</p>

<p>“One night I went down to the Battery and sat on
the sea wall there for hours looking at the water
smashing away at the rocks. It was moonlight and
almost bright enough to read a paper. I had enough
to think of while I was sitting there and I thought it,
too. I know what it is to have a whirring sound in
your brain, for I had it then. I was trying to get up
enough courage to throw myself overboard, for I
really wanted to die. I had seen all of life and of men
that I wanted and had enough. I had been driven by
a man from the place where I lived to the jumping-off
spot as coldly, and calmly, and deliberately as a
drover would direct the course of a steer to the abattoir.
He had made living impossible for me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
“Those noises in my head had reached that stage
where they were like the sound of the L road trains
going past your windows at night when you’re trying
to sleep, but the stronger they grew the less they annoyed
me, and the idea came to me that if I wished
hard enough death would come very easy.</p>

<p>“You know that old act of mine where I used to
imitate a woman who had gone insane from grief at
being abandoned by her lover? You know what a hit
it always made. Well, it’s nothing like the real thing.
Heart-breaking grief in its highest form is quiet. It
doesn’t want the limelight or stage center, but a dark
corner and seclusion. It wants to be left alone.</p>

<p>“The next thing I remember was someone saying
to me ‘Come out of here; what are you trying to do—drown
yourself?’</p>

<p>“And there I was in the water up to my waist with
a policeman holding me by the arm. He turned me
around so that I faced the wall again and we walked
back to where he helped me up. Then he took me,
all dripping and so cold that I had no feeling at all,
to the station house, where I was charged, under a most
absurd law, with attempted suicide. They were humane
enough to send for an ambulance and I was taken
to the hospital and fixed up so I could appear in court
the next morning. The man was there—the man with
his sneering smile and his air of well-fed comfort. He
had come down to look me over. He probably wanted
to see the girl who had refused nearly everything that
money could get, simply because she was not for sale
and couldn’t be bought like a new scarf or a hat of the
latest mode. He also wanted to parade his prosperity
before my misery, probably that before anything else.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
Even he must have pitied me because of my position,
and he edged over to where I was and whispered:</p>

<p>“‘It isn’t too late yet, and I want to help you.’</p>

<p>“‘You mean that you want to get me out of here?’
I asked.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ he said eagerly, ‘I want to get you out.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, if I were you,’ I told him, ‘I wouldn’t take
any chances because if I get out of here and you ever
speak to me again I will do the very best I can to kill
you.’</p>

<p>“He shrank back as if he had been stung, and so
great was his terror that I almost laughed at him.
Then he turned and walked away.</p>

<p>“That is the curtain of my story. I could begin at
the beginning and make it a long one, but what’s the
use? I could make a romance of it, or even a tragedy,
and now that I am my sane self I could even make it
a comedy. I could go over the list of things he promised
me and what he promised to do for me, and you
would think he had all the wealth of the Bank of England
at his back, but his mind ran in a groove so narrow
and his manner was so offensive that the only
thing that kept him in the human being class was the
fact that his nostrils were not shaped like those of a
swine, and that instead of grunting he used language
that was fairly intelligible. But for once he was toppled
from his self-built pedestal and he crashed down
in the wreck of his own self-conceit. Men like that
make the world seem immoral and immoral in fact,
and a few such as he would degrade the noblest profession
in the world. Egotists and atheists, believing
in nothing save self, they taint a community like a
plague.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
“Bring us some more beer, Billy, for I’m going
home. I’m tired and dead to the world.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t like to be the man you hated,” said
Ferguson.</p>

<p>“My boy, I can neither hate nor love, I am simply
numb. I have had seven proposals of marriage, both
in the profession and out of it, but there was nothing
doing. I am absolutely emotionless. I ask no favors
on account of my sex and I owe my allegiance to no
man. But I am watching my tormentor growing
gradually old. I see him once in a while, you know,
and I am keeping track of him. It’s my one joy in
life. The gray has come into his hair and it is turning
white and the wrinkles are spreading themselves over
his face like avenging fingers. I know he is not
really happy, although he pretends to be, and some
day, in some luxurious apartment, he’ll lie dying. A
million dollars will not give him one more breath
nor would a hundred millions add one more day to
his existence, and when he is very close to that gate
which always opens inward and from which there is
no retreat and I really know that he is going, then
I will laugh; not the kind of a laugh you know, boys,
but the kind of a laugh that follows a soul across the
border line of death and which keeps echoing for
ages.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever play the part of <i>Ophelia</i>?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No, but I could.”</p>

<p>And we all believed her.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_17">A TWISTED LOVE AFFAIR</h2>
</div>

<p>This is the story of a wooing that went astray.</p>

<p>There are many such stories floating around, and
they are all good, if they could only be told. But
there is the trouble, for, like family skeletons, they are
sunk so deep in the cellar or locked up so securely in
the closet that there is no getting to them, even for a
minute.</p>

<p>How these two met or where they met is of no material
difference, and here is where a romantic touch
might be introduced. The truth is that they came face
to face with each other on the boardwalk at Atlantic
City. He had been up to old Vienna while she had
taken in the show on the Pier. A dozen or more of
those high steins of Pilsner had made him a bit reckless,
and that was his only excuse. She was lonely,
and that was hers. It’s a great combination, like guncotton
and a match. All right apart, but let them meet
and the result is pyrotechnical. When they were
twenty feet apart there was a sudden flash of lightning
of the vivid brand they have on the Jersey shore, followed
by a crash of thunder heavy enough to make a
cigar store Indian step down and crawl under his
pedestal. Then a few drops of rain about the size of
a quarter, and a general scurrying for shelter.</p>

<p>The man whistled for a covered rolling chair, and
the girl with eyes shut and head down ran directly
into his arms.</p>

<div id="illo_18" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img src="images/i_164.jpg" width="440" height="653" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Atlantic City is the place for sporty girls who play the game to the limit</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
She recoiled like a rubber ball that has been thrown
up against a brick wall, while he felt to see if his watch
was still fast in the mooring at his vest.</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon,” and she gathered up her
skirts as she prepared for another flight.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it,” he answered with admiration,
“but I think you could beat Jeffries if you were trained
down a bit.”</p>

<p>“Sir!”</p>

<p>“Now don’t sir me; it’s raining and that blanket of
yours won’t stand water. I’ve an option on the only
chair in sight. It’s yours; help yourself, and if you
don’t mind I’ll go as far as my hotel. Are you on the
job?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think——” she began severely, when the
lightning broke out again and interrupted her.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to think,” he said. “Jump in and
keep out of the wet. People don’t think at Atlantic
City; they get on the job quick,” and he motioned the
walking delegate with the perambulator to move up.</p>

<p>“All right,” she said, resignedly.</p>

<p>“Of course it’s all right, for you get home dry while
I have a chance to meet a good fellow. Now let’s introduce.
My name is Ben. There’s another part to it,
but it don’t make any difference here. What’s yours?”</p>

<p>“You don’t lose any time, do you?”</p>

<p>“Never was known to so far. Come on, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Bess,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Bess; great; sounds like a sport. Not hard to say
and rhymes with ‘bless’ and ‘yes’ and a lot of other
words. Now, Bess, you and I are going to have one
little drink just to celebrate. You know the old saying—wet
out and wet in. The wise gink who’s pushing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
this van is heading me back to where I came from, I
see; Old Vienna. I wonder if he gets a commission?
Just because I like you, and because your hair matches
my tie I’ll blow you to anything you like from a second-story
stein up to a bottle—large or small, according to
your capacity. How about it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you think because you got me in this
absurd wicker basket before I could call a policeman
and have you arrested for insulting me that any proposition
you make from now on will not be objected to.
Perhaps, because I made the fatal mistake of being
alone on the walk at night, you, too, have made a
mistake.”</p>

<p>“I never make mistakes, but this time I overlooked
the fact that I am hungry. So we’ll get the large
bottle and something to eat on the side and between
drinks we’ll tell each other the story of our past lives,
and we’ll make a bet on whose is the best.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later they were like a couple of chums
who had known each other for years, and she was calling
him Ben as if she had been raised with him.</p>

<p>That was not quite a year ago, and it is only introduced
in order that the story might be told from the
very beginning.</p>

<p>A thousand trifling things happen in life which often
turn the tide or change the course of events. A man,
because his watch is a few minutes late, misses a train
which is wrecked and thus saves his life; again he
goes down one street instead of another, for no reason
that he knows of, and avoids a catastrophe or misses
an opportunity; he goes here instead of there and
something occurs which changes the course of his path
from that point on to the grave. Call it fate if you like,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
but whatever it is it is inevitable and inexorable, and
no human will has been found that is strong enough
to resist it. It is like the call of “Hands up” coming
from the desperado with a revolver. There is no alternative.
In some cases it is impulse, a seventh sense, or
pure luck—good or bad—according to results, or even
intuition. The wise man says that what is to be will be
and trails along in contentment. Others fight it out
and come forth beaten in the end.</p>

<p>The two of this story came back to New York hopelessly
in love with each other, and at that time, so far
as I know, it wasn’t the commercial love of the twentieth
century, ready to switch and change as soon as
the sun went under the first cloud. They met two,
three and four times a week, first in one place and
then in another, and they knocked about town like a
pair of happy-go-lucky Bohemians with the rent paid
a year in advance.</p>

<p>“Some day,” he said to her once, “when I am quite
free to do as I like I’m going to marry you, and then
all of this running to cover like a pair of rabbits chased
by a brown ferret that you can’t see will stop.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that I would marry you even if
you wanted it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“We’ll argue that point when the time comes,” was
the answer.</p>

<p>“Now that we’ve known each other for so long a
time—at least it seems long to me—I’ve a confession
to make to you. I ought to have told you before, but
it isn’t too late now.”</p>

<p>“Save your confession as I’m saving mine,” he said.
“I never knew these past life stories to do any good,
for both men and women make mistakes, and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
ought to do with them as the doctors do with their
failures—bury them.”</p>

<p>“But we are doing wrong now.”</p>

<p>“The boy up the farmer’s tree filling his pocket with
apples is happy until he is caught. My motto is to get
as many apples as you can until you hear the farmer
coming and then beat it while you have the wind with
you. It doesn’t require as much nerve as you think,
and any time the game isn’t worth it quit. The beaten
man in a fight, if he is game, always gets as much applause
as the victor and sometimes a great deal more.
I have seen the time when it was better to lose than to
win, strange as that may seem. I don’t believe in
figuring on what is to be years from now because I
may be dead. There is no to-morrow in life—it is all
to-day. If battles have been won, cities destroyed,
empires established and colossal fortunes swept away
in an hour what chance has a man—a mere atom on
the earth—to speculate in futures? The typhoid germ
upon an oyster, the invisible microbe of consumption
eaten or breathed in with a thousand other death-dealing
mites, can kill him as surely as a thunderbolt
or a drop of cyanide of potassium. Upon your hands
and your face at this moment are the bacteria of lockjaw
only waiting for a scratch or a wound of some
kind to enter your veins. Yet you do not worry about
that. You see you have me talking about things I do
not like and it will take at least another pint to get
the taste out of my mouth. Accept my advice, if the
sun is shining for you now don’t fear the coming
night.”</p>

<p>Through all the winter he never knew where she
lived or how she lived and he didn’t care, and that was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
because he was a philosopher, and she knew as little
about him as he did about her. A future meeting was
always arranged upon the heels of the previous one.
Her name was Bess and his was Ben and that was
sufficient.</p>

<p>Very queer, of course, and almost unbelievable, but
true nevertheless.</p>

<p>And all the while the match was getting nearer to
the guncotton and neither knew it. Playing with fire
had come to be such a habit with these two that they
didn’t fear the flames.</p>

<p>It was at a nice little afternoon luncheon that she became
first serious and then confidential. They had
reached the coffee stage—the proper time to put your
elbows on the table and talk—when she said:</p>

<p>“Ben, I want $5,000.”</p>

<p>At that particular moment he was lighting a cigarette
and he didn’t look up for a full minute, which is a
very long while if you only know the real value of
time.</p>

<p>“What for?” he asked, finally.</p>

<p>“I am married, you know. I mean you don’t know
it, but I’m telling you now, and I want to get a divorce.
I have been collecting evidence and I have all I want,
but I shall have to get a lawyer, and I shall also have
to live until the case is disposed of.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you consult me?”</p>

<p>“Why should I until I was ready?”</p>

<p>“I’m a lawyer.”</p>

<p>“Would you take the case?”</p>

<p>“No, but I could advise you.”</p>

<p>So he did, and being a very smart lawyer instead of
giving her a check for the money she wanted he gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
her what in his opinion was $5,000 worth of advice.
You see, the substance of his love of the fall had fallen
away to a shadow, and hard-headed business men
don’t invest in shadows or even pay money to build a
monument over a sentiment that is either dead or
dying. Hearts are rarely trumps; spades have the call
to-day.</p>

<p>“I’m going ahead anyhow,” she went on, “and I suppose
when I am free that even your memory will suffer
from an attack of dry rot, and that you’ll forget
everything you have ever said to me—or deny it, which
amounts to the same thing in the end.”</p>

<p>So the next day she told her story to a lawyer, not
the story of Ben and the dinners, but the tales of the
man to whom she was married, and when she produced
certain dates and facts she was told she had the
clearest kind of a clear case and that it would go
through with bells on, with hubby paying the shot.</p>

<p>The complaint was drawn up and the papers served;
and here comes the great part of this recital.</p>

<p>Just one week later a clean-cut, well-built young
business man, of about 35, walked into Ben’s office and
asked for a consultation.</p>

<p>“You have been recommended to me,” he began, “by
a business friend of mine. I have been sued for divorce
by my wife. My morals are none too good, but
neither are hers. Will you take the case and defend
me?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ben, “I’ll take it,” and he called a stenographer.
“Dictate your story to her and then see me
to-morrow, when I will have the papers drawn up. If
your counter charges amount to anything at all we can
beat her—that is, if you want to beat her. As I understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
it you don’t want her to get a divorce from you?”</p>

<p>“That’s it exactly. It isn’t that I care a rap, but I
don’t care to be made a scapegoat, and I think when
she knows what kind of an answer I have she’ll drop
the whole case and take to the woods, which will suit
me down to the ground.”</p>

<p>At 11 o’clock Ben saw the transcribed notes of the
amanuensis and he hadn’t read more than ten lines
when he jumped from his chair as though it had suddenly
become red-hot.</p>

<p>“Miss Bates,” he called sharply, “bring me your note
book.”</p>

<p>In she came and handed it to him.</p>

<p>“You’ll say nothing about this?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” but there was the suggestion of a smile
around the corners of her mouth.</p>

<p>He thrust it in his pocket and in a minute was out of
the door.</p>

<p>There was a little luncheon date on with Bess for 12
o’clock, but he couldn’t wait. He was at the appointed
place a full hour before the time, and he sat at the
table glaring at the door. Exactly on the stroke of
the hour she came in smiling.</p>

<p>“Why, Ben, what’s the matter? You look as though
you had been struck by a blizzard.”</p>

<p>“I have. Read that,” and he handed two typewritten
sheets to her. “You’ll have to drop that case of yours,
and drop it quick, too. Your husband had the nerve
to retain me to defend him; and in his counter charges
he names me as your co-respondent, and I’m damned
if he hasn’t got every move we ever made pat and to
the minute. He’s been on to everything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
He looked up suddenly and a look of suspicion came
over his face.</p>

<p>“What is this, a job? Have you two been working
me?”</p>

<p>“You contemptible thing,” she whispered, “you have
the mind of a street sweeper. How dare you talk
to me like that after all our——”</p>

<p>Two tears came into her eyes.</p>

<p>“If I were a man I would fight you and you wouldn’t
dare to fight back. You’d run. Do you hear that—you’d
run away, because you are a coward. I could
make you run away now if I wanted, because you
are afraid.”</p>

<p>Then she turned and walked out of the place without
even so much as looking behind her, and the man was
left with a lot of typewritten sheets clutched in one
hand and a stenographer’s note book in the other.</p>

<p>There was never any suit, but if you happen to New
York any day during the winter months I’ll show you
this couple—Bess who made a little mistake and
stepped out to where the daisies grow once or twice—and
her husband, who won because he was willing to
wait.</p>

<p>It sounds like a romance, I know, but it’s all true,
every word of it, for the little stenographer told me
the most of it.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_18">WEDDING RINGS AND FOOTLIGHTS</h2>
</div>

<p>There are several titles which would cover this story
with equal aptness, and one of them is The Siren
Song of the Burlesque Lady. Another one that would
sound well is the Corralling of the Willie Boy. In
fact they would do well together—a great deal better
than the lady and the boy did. I call him boy in this
story, but he is really a man so far as years and stature
go, that is all, and he is learning a lot every day, so
much so that if he keeps on he will some day be a
man in everything.</p>

<p>The burlesque show with which this perfect lady
was a spear carrier, as well as a few other things, hit
the Bowery early in the season, and opened up with
a roar that could be heard many blocks. It was the
same old thing only a little more so, and the line-up
was composed of a bunch of husky dames who ought
to have been carrying the hod instead of giving an
exhibition of beef on the hoof. The roster is a very
familiar one, with the beef-eaters sometimes in the
background like scenery, and then again in the foreground
to give the boys a good look at the tights,
two or three ginger girls, who had a small amount
of talent with a great amount of nerve, who did
stunts in the olio, and the usual collection of Irish
and Hebrew comedians, of which the least said the
better. The names on the roster would look like a
collection of heroines from the Waverly novels, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
Pearl, Pansy and Myrtle in the lead by a couple of
good lengths. It was put together according to the recipe
of a well-known manager, which was this:</p>

<div id="illo_19" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img src="images/i_174.jpg" width="440" height="646" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">They had a hot time in Minneapolis when the show hit town</div></div>

<p>“The people who pay their money for these kind of
shows, my boy, don’t want beauty, or brains or talent.
They’d go to sleep with Sarah Bernhardt doing the
death scene in ‘Camille,’ and they’d call Booth in
‘Richard the Third’ a frost. What they want is legs—good,
big husky legs that can take all the wrinkles
out of the biggest size of pink tights on the market.
They want quantity, not quality. Give them that and
you’ll get their ten, twenty and thirty every time.”</p>

<p>He wore big diamonds, had a bank roll the size of a
Hamburger steak, and so he must have been in right.
Besides he always had a bottle of wine with his meals,
and he didn’t care what kind of wine it was, so long
as the label was attractive; which goes to show that
his money was coming in so fast that his palate
couldn’t keep up with it.</p>

<p>On the night the Fair Maids of Gotham opened, the
Willie Boy, very fly up to a certain point, but with a
soft sucker part about as big as a Derby hat, planted
himself in one of the front seats. He had been mixing
up with sports all of his life, and as a result the
corners on him were as hard as flint. His roll was
divided in four parts and stowed away in four separate
places for safety’s sake, and when it came to a
hurry touch he was prepared to dig down into his
change pocket and produce a few pennies with verdigris
on them as the extent of his capital. He had a
block and a counter for every proposition that came
his way and when anything came off he always managed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
to land his percentage and ride, even though
everybody else walked.</p>

<p>The orchestra had crushed through its preliminary
canter, the lights went down, the buzz of talk let up
for a moment, and as he settled himself back in his seat
with a big cigar in his mouth the curtain slid up for
the opening chorus. The grenadiers in front swung
their legs coquettishly, and pranced about like two-legged
pachyderms as they delivered the goods in the
shape of a song, which stated in very wobbly and uncertain
rhyme that they were very jolly, very entertaining,
and that they were out for a lark and were
willing to take chances. It was all very affecting,
and it might have been going on yet if the star of the
show, known professionally as the principal boy, hadn’t
butted in like a football player when the cue, “Here
comes the Prince,” was given by a perfect lady with
a forty-six-inch bust. She was so thoroughly upholstered
with rhinestones that she looked like some new
kind of an electric light proposition on legs. Willie
sized her up with the eye of a connoisseur, and he
fell to wondering whether or not among all that paving
of cut glass there might not be a true gem.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as the line in front swayed, then broke
and shifted, he caught sight of a tall blonde who had
been fastened to it like the tail on a kite. She wasn’t
quite as wide as the rest of the bunch, but there was
something about her that attracted his immediate attention.</p>

<p>And here you see again the delicate tracery of the
Italian hand of fate—that invisible, indefinite thing
which stands always at our backs ready to move us
here and there, like chessmen on a board, whether we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
like it or not. The male human pats himself on his
shoulder and congratulates himself that he has a will
and a mind of his own, but ever near him is that
wraith which directs his movements, making him do
this or that and go here and there. There is no force,
no threat and no cajoling; it is simpler than a twist
of the wrist, and the end of that winding, twisting,
intersected road, with its hundreds of sharp turns
here and there and its joys and sorrows, is the grave.</p>

<p>So look at the boy with good red blood in his veins,
with a gentle, high-bred mother, a beautiful sister, and
a home in which there was nothing but refining influences,
sitting bolt upright now in that cheap theatre
seat and gazing like one bewitched at this girl with the
yellow hair, bleached to almost a frazzle, and the pale,
watery blue eyes, with no figure at all and absolutely
no talent, produced and spit forth from a tenement to
grow up in the city’s streets like a weed to finally
reach the most ordinary position in a most ordinary
theatrical company, where, standing on the lowest
possible level, she was satisfied. Paint, powder and
rouge made her a ghastly sight, but in his eyes she was
framed in an aureole and was as beautiful as a Madonna.</p>

<p>It was one of the things that no human being will
ever be able to account for satisfactorily. Personal
magnetism undoubtedly plays a part in it, as it does in
many other things, but you wouldn’t think a young
fellow like this would go so far out of his class unless
he had a throwback strain of degeneracy imbedded
somewhere in his system.</p>

<p>The tribe trooped off to make a change of costume
and the comedians settled down to work. Then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
ginger girls whooped things up a bit, and an acrobat
went through the routine of stunts, while a few
spasmodic outbursts of applause showed there were
some people in the house who appreciated his work.
But the pair of eyes owned by the young fellow in the
aisle seat, third row, were looking for that blonde and
nothing else.</p>

<p>Knowing everybody as he did, it wasn’t a difficult
matter for him to get someone who knew her to wait
after the show and bring them together in a rather
formal way, although, in her case, that wouldn’t have
been at all necessary. She had as little use for formalities
as she had for conventionalities, which is not
at all to be wondered at.</p>

<p>“Meet my friend Willie; now let’s all go out and
get a drink,” was all there was to it, and ten minutes
later four—two of each sex—were planted around a
table in a cafe not more than a block or so from the
theatre.</p>

<p>“Like the show?” asked the Genial Giantess, who
was keen enough to smell a little love affair in the
air.</p>

<p>“Great,” answered Willie; “it ought to get the
money this season. What are you going to drink?”</p>

<p>“I never take anything but beer after the matinee—it
hurts my voice.”</p>

<p>Strangely enough no one laughed, but with another
girl and at another time Willie would have laughed
himself almost into convulsions, for he has a keen
sense of humor.</p>

<p>The four ate and drank at that table until it was
time for the night show and then they separated, by
which time Willie was so far gone that he sat throughout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
the evening performance while she smiled encouragingly
at him from the other side of the footlights.</p>

<p>That is how the courtship really began.</p>

<p>For the rest of the week they were together all the
time, and she began to realize that she had at last
reached the apex of her ambition and found a man
who looked like a wedding ring and a board bill proposition.</p>

<p>A fellow like this can have a dozen affairs and no
one will question them, but when it comes to marrying
there is a different story. To the outsiders it
bore all the earmarks of a week’s stand at first, and
as he never showed his hand no one was any the
wiser, not even his most intimate friends.</p>

<p>A man’s declaration of love for a woman is a very
beautiful thing so long as he is honest about it and
keeps within his own class. The slang of the slums
can be made as sincere as the most polished English.
But in a case of infatuation like this—it might be
called temporary insanity—it doesn’t hardly seem
right there should be any ceremony. The halo of
romance existed only in the mind of the boy—for the
woman it was a business transaction with the obligations
all on one side, so it was with a flippant air that
she promised to “love, honor and obey,” and then
after the briefest of brief honeymoons she went on
the road with the show, while the young husband at
once set about preparing a home for her when she
should get ready to settle down to a life of domesticity.</p>

<p>At first he figured on taking her to his mother’s
home, but when he told of the hurry-up wedding and
showed a picture of the woman to whom he had given
his name, the scene that followed forever settled the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
question, and he knew that his soubrette wife and his
mother would never live under the same roof together.</p>

<p>The morals of the members of a burlesque show on
the road have come to be a joke. Of course, there are
exceptions, but they are very rare, though I personally
know of some good women who have gone on
tour through force of circumstances and have come
through the ordeal morally and physically clean. I
regret to be compelled to record that the Genial Giantess
doesn’t belong in this class, and when the aggregation
had torn thirty weeks off the calendar they
came back looking like refugees from the San Francisco
earthquake.</p>

<p>“I ain’t got a cent,” remarked the blonde on the
ferryboat coming from Jersey City, “and I don’t have
to have because Willie will stake me as soon as I get
to New York, and besides he’s got a flat fixed up for
me.”</p>

<p>That was the truth. He had a nice apartment for
the homecoming, and while he wasn’t as much in love
with her as he was when they were first married, he
still felt that he had obligations and he ought to make
good.</p>

<p>You know what I said in the beginning about fate?
Well, listen.</p>

<p>While the performers were on the ferryboat, and
when Blondie was making her celebrated remark, her
Willie was up against a bar on Broadway with a
couple of men he had met some time before. They
were talking about women, and one, a commercial
traveler, remarked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
“I’ll put you up against a warm bunch if you want
to get on the job this week. We didn’t do a thing to
them in Minneapolis when I was there on my last trip.
I had a big blonde on my staff, and the first night I
met her I loaded her up so that she had to be carried
upstairs to her room by three waiters. Here’s a letter
I got from her last week, and while she’s no ten thousand
dollar beauty yet she’s a good fellow and a thoroughbred
sport. Read it, Willie. When she hits this
burg I’ll put you next and bet 20 to 1 that she’ll
drink you to a standstill, for she’s the biggest tank I
ever ran across.”</p>

<p>And when Willie read the letter which bore his
wife’s signature and which put him wise to a few
things he had never before dreamed of, he did what
many another man would do under the same circumstances—that
is, many another wise man. He ordered
a round of drinks, and then he kept on ordering and
saying nothing, letting the other fellows tell all they
knew, and the first chance he got he blew out and
went home, not to the place he had fixed up for Mrs.
Willie, but to the home presided over by his mother.
He simply abandoned the flat and all of his day
dreams. They vanished like mist in the morning’s
sun.</p>

<p>A few days later he got a letter from his wife and
in it she reproached him for not meeting her, and
furthermore she inquired what had become of the flat
he had fixed up for her.</p>

<p>“I am broke, you know,” she wrote, “and I think
the least you could do is to help me out.”</p>

<p>She signed it “Your loving (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sic</i>) and affectionate
wife,” and it almost gagged him to read it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
He took a sheet of paper and wrote the answer. It
contained but one line, but it told a whole chapter. In
due course of time it was delivered to her. She
opened the envelope and read the enclosure. What
she said was unfit for publication, for what she saw
was only two words and they were:</p>

<p>“Forget it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_19">TOLD BY THE MANICURE GIRL</h2>
</div>

<p>“How long have you been here?” asked the man
with the black mustache; “I never noticed you before.”</p>

<p>“Just a week to-day,” said the manicure, as she
soused one of his fat, pudgy paws in the scented water.
She didn’t even take the trouble to look up at him as
she talked, but applied herself at once to the almost
impossible task of making his nails even presentable.
It’s a hard job, you know, trying to improve on one
of nature’s bum pieces of work.</p>

<p>The man leaned back in his chair contentedly, and
with that air of assurance which money begets, and
he looked her over as he would have looked over a
new style of shirt in a haberdasher’s window. He
noted that her hair was dark chestnut in color and
luxuriant, also that it was undoubtedly all her own.
The contour of her face was such as would have attracted
any man with red blood in his veins and a
heart to pump it. She had, besides, nice hands that
were well kept, and a dainty manner that was rather
charming.</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever get tired of doing this kind of
work?” he asked, when he had finished his inspection
and had sized her up to his apparent satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I am always tired of it,” she answered, briefly.</p>

<p>“How would you like to travel?” was his next question.</p>

<div id="illo_20" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img src="images/i_184.jpg" width="438" height="653" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">“I wasn’t arrested, but I was put out as if I were a common swindler”</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
Then she paused a moment and glanced up. She
was smiling, and the two dimples that came in her
cheeks rather enhanced her beauty.</p>

<p>Then he saw that she also had teeth that were white
and regular, that her lips were red and her eyelashes
long.</p>

<p>You know a bargaining man takes in all these things,
just the same as a buyer of beef on the hoof feels and
prods the cattle in the search for blemishes.</p>

<p>“There is nothing in the world I would like better
than to travel.”</p>

<p>She looked him squarely in the eyes, and her smile
was accentuated. Then she resumed her work. As
for him he leaned still farther back in the comfortable
chair and sucked complacently on his big Havana.</p>

<p>“I knew you was a nice little girl as soon as I saw
you.”</p>

<p>“Did you?”</p>

<p>The rapid, supple fingers never paused for a moment
in their work, and were trimming, rubbing and
polishing those awful nails into some kind of decent
shape. The thick, heavy, hairy hand, with its spatulate
extremities, showed physical strength and nothing
else. It was made for work, and it had worked, too,
in its day. It had been used to the most ordinary and
menial kind of labor, as the hands of its ancestors had.
It had lifted beams and handled picks and shovels. It
had pulled at ropes and tugged at heavy burdens. It
had had little to do with the gentler side of life, and
even the big diamond ring on the fourth finger could
not hide its early career.</p>

<p>But an accident happened—a money-making accident
which some might call opportunity—and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
hands had been withdrawn from their labors, and the
callous spots had a chance to disappear—gradually,
but none the less surely. The movement of the slim
white fingers caused him to look down, and he was
conscious of the fact that his heart was beating a bit
faster than usual. The blue smoke from his cigar
curled up through his mustache, it crept into his eyes
and made them sting. Through the haze he noticed
that the girl had a bow of black ribbon fastened to her
hair.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you’d be a good sport if you had the
chance.”</p>

<p>“That depends upon what you mean by the chance,”
she said.</p>

<p>He couldn’t quite analyze that, and so he blurted
out:</p>

<p>“Go down the line with me and I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>She paid no attention to that.</p>

<p>“How about it?” he persisted.</p>

<p>“How about what?”</p>

<p>“I’d just like to take you out to a little lunch for two.
What time do you break away from here? What time
do you knock off?”</p>

<p>“To-night, do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Sure, yes, to-night.”</p>

<p>“Just time enough to go home, and I never go out at
night.”</p>

<p>“Tush, tush, now. Be a good fellow, and if I like
you I’ll take you on a long trip. You know you said
you liked to travel, didn’t you? Well, I’m going to
give you a chance, if you behave yourself and stick
to me. I’ve been looking for a girl like you for a long
while, and you just hit me right, so you’re on the job.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
I can make good, all right, you needn’t be afraid of
that, for I’ve got all kinds of money, and when I meet
anybody I like I spend it like a drunken sailor, see?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see; I knew you had money all the time.”</p>

<p>“You did, did you; well, how?”</p>

<p>“Because it is only men with plenty of money who
would talk to a girl the way you have been talking to
me. It is only the men with money who think they
can buy everything in sight, especially if that which
they think they fancy happens to be the wearer of
a skirt, and it’s the men with money who think their
money is better than anybody else’s money, and their
dollars are of more value than the dollars owned or
controlled by some one who has less than they have.
Are you married?”</p>

<p>“No,” he answered. He would have said more if he
had known what to say.</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you go and pick out some woman
whom you like and who likes you, and marry her and
have it over with. Your time for being a gay sport
has passed; leave that to the young fellows.”</p>

<p>Daintily she reddened his nails with rouge, doing
them as carefully as if they were works of art, and tapping
each one gently in order to get just the right
amount of color.</p>

<p>“I don’t think,” she went on, “that you quite know
what you’ve been up against. You may have heard
the old saying, ‘a burnt child dreads the fire;’ well, I’m
the child in this case, although I’m no child in years.
As I told you before, I’ve been here a week, and it’s a
great relief to me to be working, for I’ve been on one
of those little trips you were just talking about, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
there is nothing to it. You see,” then she glanced up
quickly, “perhaps you don’t want to hear this.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right; go ahead, you can’t hurt my feelings.”</p>

<p>“I was told that I was a good fellow and a nice girl,
and I was led to believe that I could have anything in
the world that I wanted, and I want to tell you right
here that it is a beautiful thing to believe and have
faith in anyone. Some of the stories that men tell to
women would make great reading if it was only
written right, but they would be all fiction, because I
don’t believe a man ever told a woman the truth in his
life. I’m talking from personal experience, of course.
This one man, who was really old enough to be my
father, talked to me about my future, and said, among
other things, he would always look after me, and I was
serious enough about it to believe that he would, too.
Then one day he asked me if I wanted to take a little
trip, and his words were so much like yours when you
spoke that you startled me. Isn’t it strange that the
nails of your left hand take on so much higher polish
than those of the right hand? I wonder why it is?
There, <em>I’m</em> through now. Fifty cents, please.”</p>

<p>“But how about the finish of that story? Did you
take the trip?”</p>

<p>“Of course I took it.”</p>

<p>“Make the job a dollar and tell me the rest.”</p>

<p>“I never would have believed that I would be sitting
here telling that story to a man whom I had only met
once. You’re not offended at the way I criticised you,
are you?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” he answered, “go ahead and criticise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
me all you like. I rather like it, it’s so seldom that I
am criticised.”</p>

<p>“You mean nowadays?” she asked, noting his hands.</p>

<p>“Yes, since I got money. Go on with the story.”</p>

<p>“The trip was to be to Europe—first London, then
Paris, and after that Berlin. He was a banker and so
prominent that you would know his name at once if I
were to mention it, but there is where I draw the line.
I’ll save him that much, anyhow. When we left he
had a large bag in which he seemed to take an especial
interest, for he would allow no one to touch it but himself,
and it wasn’t until we were half way across that I
found out that it was all full of money.”</p>

<p>“Money?” queried the man with the black mustache,
sitting bolt upright in his chair.</p>

<p>“Yes, money. That’s what I said, wasn’t it?” she
asked, petulantly. “Brand new greenbacks, pound
notes, hundred and thousand-franc notes. Oh, they
were beautiful to look at, and I counted over the packages
because they were so pretty. You see, he said he
was going over to put through a big banking deal, and
he cautioned me to say nothing about all the money he
had with him, for fear he would be robbed. When we
arrived in London we went direct to the Cecil, where
he registered under an assumed name, but I was down
on the book as his wife, just the same, and he told me
to go out and get some clothes and anything I wanted.
He said he wanted to have some of the big bills
changed and that was the easiest way in the world to
have it done, but he asked me to bring all the change
to him, and to pay for every separate article with one
of the new bills. I thought it was rather queer at the
time, but I did as he told me and I never in my life had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
such a good time buying things. I brought back to the
hotel a dreadful amount of change, so much that it
was a nuisance.</p>

<p>“Every day it was the same thing over again until I
honestly grew tired of spending money. Think of
that—tired spending. Before we left for Paris he put
over $15,000 of the change in a safe deposit vault that
only he and I knew about, because something had happened
and he had to get to Paris quickly. When we
got there we went to the Grand Hotel, where he registered
under still another name. Again I went shopping,
and the only hard part of it was that I had a new
bill to change every time I bought anything, think of
that, even if it was a little lunch in a cafe, and many
a time I have had to wait while they sent out for the
change of a thousand-franc note. We were there just
four days when one afternoon two men came to our
rooms with the proprietor or manager of the hotel, and
the first thing I knew he was arrested on the charge of
making or having counterfeit money or something like
that. Before they got him out of the room he whispered
to me that he had put $15,000 more in a safe
deposit vault in Paris, and he told me the name of
the place. He said it was in my name, too.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t arrested, but I was put out of the hotel as
if I had been a swindler. I had enough money to get
home, and so I came. I don’t want any more excitement
in mine, and I’m content to get along the best
way I can, without any fireworks or trips of any kind,
unless, of course, <em>I’m</em> sure that everything is absolutely
correct and all right. Suppose I had been broke,
what would I have done alone in Paris?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
“What happened to the man?” he asked, ignoring
her question.</p>

<p>“He was tried and sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment,
and if he had only married me, and I had
my marriage certificate, I could go over there and get
$30,000 as easy as nothing. I don’t care so very much
for it, but still it would come in very handy and I
wouldn’t mind dividing it up with anyone who could
help me out.”</p>

<p>The man fidgeted in his chair, glanced out of the
window, and then took a long pull at his cigar.</p>

<p>“Bored you, didn’t it?” asked the girl. “I knew it
would, but you insisted on my telling it, and you’re the
only one that knows it. I’m really getting garrulous.”</p>

<p>“Do you think $5,000 would be enough to get the
papers fixed up?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that would be quite enough, for I inquired
about it. It would take me there and back again and
pay all expenses.”</p>

<p>“And you’d give me half?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course I would. Who wouldn’t?”</p>

<p>You know the old saying about a sucker being born
every minute. I could go on and make the usual hot
finish to this story, but what’s the use when two lines
will suffice. She got the money, of course, and he got
what is known in the language of The Line as the
lemon. Very sour it was for this hard, wise fellow,
and they say that now every time he passes a manicure
parlor he turns his head the other way and says things
which wouldn’t look well in print.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_20">INVESTING IN A HUSBAND</h2>
</div>

<p>Money makes the mare go.</p>

<p>Sure.</p>

<p>That is, sometimes, if it’s the right kind of a mare
and there is enough money.</p>

<p>Take out all the “ifs” and “buts” and it will be all
right.</p>

<p>The world began with a man, Adam, and the woman
came later, but the finish will be different, for there
will be a woman in the last ditch giving or ready
to give the avenging angel the stiffest kind of an argument.</p>

<p>This story differs from the Creation in that it begins
with a woman, as all stories of to-day should.
And why not? for take the lady out of the case and
there’s no story and never will be. The slim finger of
a woman, you know, is in every pie. Sometimes it improves
the flavor and sometimes it spoils it—that’s a
matter of luck—and there are men who have tried
pies or many fingers, whichever simile you prefer, and
the result in their cases is always the same.</p>

<p>The girl in this story had birth, and blood, and
breeding behind her. She also had good looks and a
little money, and that is about all that anyone wants.
Add to that a fairly nice disposition and you have
reached the limit.</p>

<p>Of course, she wasn’t perfect by any means. She
was a bit whimsical and peculiar, and her moods were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
as apparent as the moving pictures thrown on a sheet
in the theatre. She was unusual in that her
moods were reflected in her face with all the truthfulness
of a mirror. That was the reason that some said
she was good-looking, while others contended that she
was most ordinary. Take her as I’ve often seen her,
when she was cheerful and happy-go-lucky, and while
there was nothing about her features that was regular
she was attractive enough for anyone, and she could
make a good many young fellows turn their heads to
look after her as she passed down the street.</p>

<p>Then again something would happen, and she would
seem to age ten years in as many hours, and a crop of
deep lines and wrinkles would spring out like magic.
But she had magnetism, and she was forever standing
at the fork of two roads, one of which led to good and
the other to bad. To her it was the toss of a coin which
one she would take.</p>

<p>It was while she was in a thoughtful mood, debating
with herself, that the man came along. There’s
an apology goes with that, for he hadn’t a vote yet,
and he was very youthful in his ways and of that age
where a youngster is apt to tell more than is good for
him, and to stray from the field of fact. Of course,
it’s not a crime—it’s only a period. With his red
cheeks and baby complexion he looked like a cross between
a stick of peppermint candy and one of Raphael’s
cherubs. He was as pretty a piece of embroidery
as ever asked his mother for spending money, and
when the girl saw him she immediately threw out a
line and took him in tow. Inside of twenty-four hours
she had her monogram indelibly stamped on him, and
he was hers. Hand in hand they went out to see the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
world and become real sports, and it wasn’t long before
wine was the limit and it wasn’t half good enough
at that. They left a lurid streak up and down the
line, but it soon faded out, for they weren’t financially
strong enough to make a splash that would attract any
more attention than a pair of tiny gold fish in a two-dollar
aquarium.</p>

<p>After all, it amounts to nothing more or less than a
question of capacity—stomach as well as purse, and it
is rarely that the two harmonize. The man with the
yard-wide thirst is often handicapped by a purse with
complete or partial paralysis.</p>

<p>And then these two fell in with other company in
the shape of a man and woman whose nuptials had
been attended by incidents of a more or less exciting
character, the star part of which was an elopement
which savored more of desire than genius in its arrangements.
They had succeeded so well in their new
venture that they owned the entire contents of a flat
across the river in Jersey, and being still in the throes
of love themselves—or thinking they were—they were
headquarters for everything that seemed like an affair
of the heart. Some who were not their friends were
unkind enough to say that it was nothing more nor
less than a case of misery loving company, and that
being on the coals themselves this couple enjoyed leading
others to the broiler. But that’s unkind and
really ought not to be believed.</p>

<p>However, many a racket came off in the flat, and
they all went as hot a pace as wind and weather permitted,
until even a rank outsider would have said it
was time for a minister to get on the job and do what
he could to make things legal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
The cork popped from a bottle of wine and the juice
of the grape sizzled out.</p>

<p>“What do you say, Kid, let’s get married?”</p>

<p>“All right, I’m game if you are; you can’t phaze
me,” she said.</p>

<p>“Well, how about to-night?”</p>

<p>“The sooner the better.”</p>

<p>Talk about quick action, it was here with a vengeance.</p>

<p>Four people on a ferryboat, then an elevated railroad
and the ringing of a minister’s door bell.</p>

<p>It’s all very simple.</p>

<p>The dinner afterward in a cafe, very informal, you
know, to harmonize with the ceremony, with a couple
of quarts for luck sandwiched in by cocktails and highballs;
then a few brief telegrams:</p>

<p>“Married to-night; wish us luck;” you know the
rest.</p>

<p>It was all right, after all, apparently, and everybody
did wish them luck, even if there were a few bad
spots in the job. But, you see, they suited themselves
and there was no one else to be taken into consideration,
not even the relatives. This going around and
holding consultations in advance is no good, and people
who are in love or who think they are in love
don’t want advice of any kind, except the kind that
rings the door bell of a minister’s hut or buys a wedding
ring and sends it with the words:</p>

<p>“Get busy before it is too late.”</p>

<p>I’m no critic, and I don’t pretend to criticise
here. I’m simply telling a story which may or may
not be true, but I’m not going to be responsible for it
any more than the man who rents a place and plants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
flowers in the garden is responsible for the architecture
of the house on the premises.</p>

<p>It is said that the bride in this case was kind enough
to supply the funds for the honeymoon, while the nice
boy supplied the beauty and called it even. In the
eyes of the lady it seems a fair enough proposition,
but harsh things are liable to be said of such a combination,
even though it is no one’s business.</p>

<p>When they returned from the fields of fruits and
flowers the boy had made up his mind, like the Count
Boni de Castellane, that being a husband was much
better than holding down a job in an office, and so
they settled in New York like a pair of pigeons after
a long flight. He had no more idea of the responsibilities
of married life than a six-months’-old infant
has of playing the races. With a place to sleep and
a feed bag always ready for his face he was satisfied,
but that was because of his youth. You see, marrying
from the cradle has both its advantages and its
drawbacks, according to the way you look at it.</p>

<p>For him every morning was Christmas, and the tree
was always fixed up with something nice with his
name on it. Do you blame him for looking pleasant?
Press the button for a dollar, press it twice and you
get five. Just as easy as drawing money out of the
bank when you have a check book.</p>

<p>But with all going out and nothing coming in it
doesn’t last long, and when he had swept up all the
spare change in sight he began to cast his covetous eye
upon the big bundle that was tied up with a woolen
string.</p>

<p>He knew something about the racing game—just
enough to get stung when the time came—and he knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
a man who was good enough to offer him a half interest
in a racing mare that had been kept under cover
for a year or so, but who could, if she was let out, beat
anything that ever wore pigskin. To that infantile
mind of his this was the one great chance of a lifetime
and the thousand-dollar bill was the key which would
unlock the door to wealth.</p>

<p>Money without working for it.</p>

<p>Why it was a pipe. Besides, it made a beautiful and
alluring tale for the bride, who had reached that stage
where she didn’t want her boy away from her, not even
for a minute. With the thousand he would make the
initial investment, and with the rest of the bank roll he
would bet. With paper and pencils they sat at the
table one night and rolled up two thousand to the fortune
of a Rockefeller.</p>

<p>How easy it is to make money that way. All you
have to do is to begin with any amount, even a penny,
and if your pencil holds out you’ll have a million in
less than no time, but you can’t buy anything with it—there’s
the trouble. The man in the insane asylum
who imagined that every stone in the construction of
the building was of pure gold and that it belonged to
him was just as rich in his own mind as the wealthiest
human being in the world—and happier, too, I’ll bet
you.</p>

<p>They planned it all out, even to the trip to Europe on
the winnings of the first big race, for she would carry
odds of not less than 20 to 1, because she was unknown.</p>

<p>A little trip down to the bank and out came the
money in brand new bills that were very good to
look at.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
So the first step was taken, and the boy made up his
mind that he had turned his back forever upon such
things as ten-dollar-a-week jobs.</p>

<p>It doesn’t require any ingenuity or brains for a man
to separate himself from such things as thousand-dollar
bills—in fact it’s quite easy. Consequently it didn’t
require any brain work on the part of the boy to deplete
the account by just that amount within a very
short time. For his new bill he received in return
a slip of paper which stated that he was the half owner
of the racing mare known as Blue Monday, and that
in consideration of his paying one-half of the training
expenses of the said mare he was to be entitled to one-half
of the winnings, less jockey fees and other incidentals.</p>

<p>To him it sounded beautiful and it took not less than
one quart to celebrate this new business venture—paid
for by the lady, of course, but still, in view of the fact
that they were one, it was all right.</p>

<p>Then there began to come to him via the U. S. Mail,
certain sundry statements concerning the expenses of
putting this fine bit of horse flesh into the proper condition
to bring home the money, and the request for
immediate remittance. There was variety enough
about these statements, too, to satisfy the most fastidious,
and the amounts ranged all the way from six dollars
and fifty cents to an even hundred. The clever
mind of the bride took in the situation at a glance, but
the faith of the optimistic kid held as fast as a ship’s
anchor to a rock ledge, and he could see nothing but
success in the near future.</p>

<p>You know there is never a day so far away that it
doesn’t come at last. So it was that the day of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
long expected race arrived and down deep in the
trousers pockets of the Pink Cheeked One was $150,
the last shot in the locker.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Kid,” he said to her. “It’s just as I
thought, she’s a twenty-five to one shot, and I’m going
to plank every cent down. At those odds we’ll take
home with us $3,750, and I guess that’ll hold us for
awhile. How about it?”</p>

<p>“But suppose she doesn’t win?”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t win? What’s the matter with you—are you
getting cold feet? How can she lose? Didn’t we clock
her this morning on the try-out and didn’t she beat
the track time? Wait till you know more about this
game and you’ll see where <em>I’m</em> right.”</p>

<p>I don’t know much more about it than that, but the
files of papers of that date show me that Blue Monday,
mare, 3-year-old, was entered for the Seaside
stakes of $1,500, at odds of 25 to 1; there was a good
start, with her in the lead. At the quarter she had
fallen back to fourth, at the half she had crept up until
she lapped the second horse.</p>

<p>She finished seventh.</p>

<p>I should say that blue-eyed boy was looking for a
job the next day, but I’m not fortune teller enough to
know whether he connected or not.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_21">TRAINING AN OLD SPORT</h2>
</div>

<p>Come and listen to the siren song of the New
York girl, and perhaps it may interest you for awhile.
There is no question about it unless you are a bronze
statue standing on a gray stone pedestal in some park,
or a cigar store Indian with an Hebraic nose and a
wooden tomahawk. In the first place the New York
girl has been conceded to be a wonder and about the
best in the world in looks as well as in figure. She
has a fine complexion when she gives it a chance to
show itself, and, like the little girl in the story book,
when she’s good she’s very, very good, and when she’s
bad she’s a peach. The thing is to pick out the right
one, and your chances for that are just as good as
drawing to a pair in poker. Some say it’s luck, while
others favor the science idea.</p>

<p>With that for an overture, let’s ring the bell for the
curtain to go up on the charming little two-act play,
entitled “The Redemption of a Sport.”</p>

<p>The Old Sport has been up against every proposition
the sun ever shone on, and there was nothing he
wasn’t fly to. He had paid board for blondes and
brunettes as well as a few Leslie Carters, to say nothing
of an Albino he once took a fancy to. He was an
early and late bird, and he was known up and down
the line by his first name, which is a distinction that it
usually takes a lot of money or a number of years, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
sometimes both, to acquire, and even then it’s not a
lead pipe cinch that you’ll land it right.</p>

<div id="illo_22" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img src="images/i_202.jpg" width="443" height="641" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">A light flashed out on the landing and revealed the figure of a beautiful woman</div></div>

<p>This fellow was good to the girls, and could be relied
on for a five-case note on a hurry touch at any time,
for he had no buttons on his pockets, and he knew
that safe deposit vaults in heaven are only used for
the storing of golden crowns in hot weather.</p>

<p>“If I can’t take my money with me,” he said once,
“then I’ll spend it here, for if there’s anything in the
world that I hate it is to think that there’s going to be
a lot of hungry relatives picking over the bones of my
estate before I get comfortably settled in the six feet
of real estate that no one can beat me out of. The
money’s got to be spent some time, and I’m going to be
the one to get the credit for it because it’s mine.”</p>

<p>But there came a time in his life when he felt that
he wanted to get away from the mob. He had been
stung by the bee of domesticity and didn’t know it.
What he did know was that he wanted a place with a
real woman in it, where he could hang his hat and that
he could call his own. If he had wanted to put his
brains at work he would have known that it was nothing
more nor less than the law of nature which had
him fast—that same law which makes a bird build a
nest in a tree, or a wild animal pre-empt a bed of moss
under the roots of a certain tree.</p>

<p>It was the home instinct.</p>

<p>So he began to cast his eye around for a side partner
whom he could have and hold, even if he had to coax
her up to the altar with a marriage license printed in
red and gold and lasso her with a wedding ring. From
that time on he was always on the alert for the right
one to come along, and every time he heard a sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
like a skirt he made an investigation. In about ten
days he turned down all the Dollies and Mauds of
the Line, for he couldn’t see where they would have a
look-in if the cook happened to leave in a hurry and
he arrived home with a backwoods appetite. You see
he wanted a gas-stove performer who could in an
emergency tell the difference between a roast and a
ragout in the raw state, and who could juggle with a
lot of cold grub in the ice box, and turn out a square
meal that was not only hot but nourishing. He was
tired of restaurant hash, anyhow, and he was longing
for the kind of biscuits that mother used to make.</p>

<p>He figured for awhile on a girl named Elsie, who
could make a cocktail to beat the band, and who could
also drink more and get away with it than any of the
rest. She was a good looker, too, and she had trotted
in double harness before, but he found out that she
was a bit promiscuous in her tastes, and he didn’t care
to feel that he had to stay at home all the time in order
to keep her from entertaining any stranger in a pair
of trousers who happened along. So he put a red cross,
which means “Danger, Keep Off,” opposite her name,
and began looking in another direction.</p>

<p>He changed his tactics completely.</p>

<p>“I’m on now,” he said to himself. “I’ll hunt up some
nice little innocent girl who doesn’t know anything of
the world, and who has taken a course in a cooking
school. I want the kind whose ambition in life is to be
boss of a nice three-story house, and who doesn’t care
any more for Broadway than a hobo does for a hot
bath. I’ll just hunt up some mother’s girl who has her
hair hanging down her back in a big, thick braid, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
I’ll sing her a song that’ll make her think I’m the real
thing on wheels.”</p>

<p>So with that very laudable and commendable idea he
started out. He didn’t figure that a tough old nut like
he was had any right to go up against a game like that,
and that his play was to mix with people of his own
class. But you’ll find in nine cases out of ten that the
worse a man is or has been the more innocence and
purity he wants when he is figuring on giving a sky
pilot a chance to make a dollar or two.</p>

<p>But having made up his mind the kind of a field he
was going to hunt, the next question was how to break
in. All the girls he knew were, without exception, of
the brand which are at their best when the lights are
turned on, who rent flats for business purposes, and
who change quarters when an intimation is made by
the captain of a police precinct that the change will do
them good. To save his life he couldn’t figure out this
new proposition, and he was like the man who bought
a new double-barreled shotgun and then found out he
couldn’t get a permit to hunt the birds the old farmer
owned.</p>

<p>And now right here, at the critical moment, in steps
fate, luck, or destiny, it doesn’t matter which, for they
are all the same, and shuffles the cards for a new deal.</p>

<p>An automobile on Broadway bumped hard enough
into the rear end of a hansom cab to almost throw the
driver from his seat and to make him swear a blue
streak of profane eloquence. The usual crowd collected,
and in the bunch caught there by the sudden rush
of curious and morbid humanity was the Old Sport.
He pushed with both elbows to free himself and then
stepped back testily. A girl behind him cried out with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
pain, and he turned suddenly around to find himself
face to face with as choice a little blonde as ever carried
books home from school, and, furthermore, she
had a braid down her back.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, did I hurt you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you did; you stepped on my foot.”</p>

<p>“Well, just take my arm and let me help you out of
this crowd.”</p>

<p>Easy if you only know how and the chance comes
your way.</p>

<p>The Old Sport wasn’t really old—not over forty—and
he was there with the looks, and the little lady
rather liked the way he framed up, as anyone could see
by the way she cuddled up to him as she limped along.
His heart was beating it like a yeggman coming East
on a brake beam, and already he was figuring on how
to handle this new proposition.</p>

<p>If it had been one of those other girls he would have
said:</p>

<p>“You just send your trunk up to my place, and we’ll
go around and have a talk to a minister; how about
it?”</p>

<p>But he couldn’t say that to this girl with the pink in
her cheeks and the fluffy hair that had never been up
against the peroxide.</p>

<p>“Foot pretty bad, Kid?” was the way he broke the
ice.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, thank you, it’s all right now, but it hurt me
a lot at first.”</p>

<p>“Live far from here?” he came back again.</p>

<p>“No, not very far; only Fifty-third street.”</p>

<p>There was only ten blocks to go, and when they got
to the last one he knew all about her. He knew that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
she was living with her aunt, and that she was taking
music lessons because some day she hoped to be able to
teach. As they paused for a moment on the corner,
he said:</p>

<p>“If you should happen along on Forty-second street
to-morrow about 2, I’ll be glad to see you.”</p>

<p>It was a bit crude, but it went all right and the date
was made. When she walked away he stood looking
after her, and he noticed that she had a nice trim figure,
a dainty little foot and that she stepped out like a
thoroughbred.</p>

<p>“You for me,” he remarked, and then he hustled
back to find some one he could treat, so great was his
joy.</p>

<p>So there’s the picture, to use a theatrical term, and
the curtain goes down on it for the end of the first act.</p>

<p>Now, you and I and some of the rest of the thirsty
crowd will go out and have a drink between acts, but
it’s a warm night and instead of one drink there’s half
a dozen. Time flies when you’re in good company and
the Old Sport was taking no chances. Ten interviews
with the girl—ten good, square, honest talks at the
rate of a talk a day—and she consented to take a chance
with him and tell the folks afterward. He was on the
level, though, and when she went home a couple of
days later she had the little certificate with her, and
after a few tears Auntie was invited around to visit her
new nephew and look over the new house.</p>

<p>As for the Sport, he settled down as comfortably as
an old buff Cochin-China hen on a dozen eggs, and he
made up his mind that he had been missing a good
many years of real dyed-in-the-wool happiness while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
he was traveling The Line with the bunch and throwing
all kinds of booze under his belt.</p>

<p>But when the weeks began to add themselves into
months he grew a bit restless of nights and it came
pretty hard when any of the boys asked him to come
along and help them crack a bottle. He took the
Mrs. to the show once in a while, but it was always a
case of hurry home as soon as the orchestra began to
play “My Country, ’Tis of Thee.” He didn’t want to
take a chance of being caught by any of the Merry-Merrys
who were out for the rent and guyed for “marrying
decent.” Once or twice he thought he had made
a mistake and that the change was too great or too
sudden for him, but an hour later when he had his
slippers on and was planted in the big armchair in the
corner, he knew he wouldn’t make any kind of a
change for the world, and he felt that he had lost a
good many years out of his life in not getting into this
kind of a game sooner. Like an old fire horse, he was
all right as long as he didn’t smell fire. But the time
was coming, and it was as sure as rent, taxes or death.</p>

<p>It came when he went out one night to be gone not
more than a half hour, and when he tried his key in
the lock it was 2 A. M., and the girl, her eyes red from
crying with the desertion and the loneliness of it all,
had fallen asleep, fully dressed, across the foot of the
bed. He was very sorry and penitent, but for all that
he went out the next night just the same, and after
that he was never in. He was back on the old trail,
mixing once more, to the great delight of the crowd.
The novelty of home had worn off, and when his wife
waited up for him she usually found him too drunk to
understand what she was saying to him. From one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
step it is easy to take another, or, as the Chinese say,
the creeper always walks in the end. He took to bringing
friends home with him at all hours, especially between
three and six in the morning, and their arrival
was always made apparent by the wild time they had
scrambling up the stairs.</p>

<p>Now, in this story—as in real life—always keep your
eye on the lady. It doesn’t make any difference where
she comes from, whether it’s New York City or Lower
Squankum, New Jersey, she is either one of two things,
very clever or very dull. There is no medium, for
what may seem to you like a medium is only a counterfeit
and not the real article. For every ninety-nine dull
women there is one clever woman; for every ninety-nine
clever women there is one ace who tops the
rest as easily as Mont Blanc tops an ant hill. The wife
in this case was not one of the dullards, that’s a cinch.
If she had been she would have made an idiot of herself
and acted the way the rest of them do—which is
a great nuisance and annoying to any man. She was
a genius, and I ask you to take off your hat to her—as
I do.</p>

<p>“I notice,” she remarked to Old Sport one morning,
“that you never bring more than one friend home
with you when you arrive. Why don’t you bring half
a dozen, or three, anyhow? It would be much more
companionable.”</p>

<p>He was a bit on his guard at first, but she convinced
him that she was serious about it, and then he began to
congratulate himself that he had his wife well in hand.</p>

<p>Two nights later he arrived with half a dozen of the
hottest hooters that ever held an all-night session in a
furnished flat. He let them in with his key, and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
they paused at the foot of the stairs, a clock from
somewhere chimed out a silvery “three.”</p>

<p>“Come on, boys; open house here; everything goes,”
said Old Sport. “My wife says my friends are good
enough for her if they’re good enough for me. Come
on.”</p>

<p>He, with another, made the start up the stairs, but
they hadn’t gone more than a few steps when a brilliant
light from the landing somewhere fairly dazzled them.</p>

<p>Directly in front of them, apparently in the act of
stepping out of a huge picture frame, was the symmetrical
figure of an almost nude woman. The light
struck her just right and brought out every detail.</p>

<p>“Great,” shouted someone from the foot of the
stairs.</p>

<p>“Shut up, you fool, it’s my wife,” answered the
Sport. “Put out that light up there, do you hear? Put
it out.”</p>

<p>But it blazed away as steadily as ever, and there was
no movement on the part of the figure, except that the
full bosom rose and fell with the regularity of her
breathing.</p>

<p>The Sport turned around on the stairs.</p>

<p>“Come out of here, you fellows; this is going too far.
Come on, skiddoo, all of you.”</p>

<p>And when the last one had gone out he slammed the
door behind them. What happened inside is none of
your business, nor mine, either, because I don’t believe
in scandal, but any evening the Old Sport is wanted he
will be found at his home address with his wife and a
kid who looks like him.</p>

<p>As for the lady; she has a genius that she is just beginning
to appreciate.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_22">CONCERNING A SYRIAN BEAUTY</h2>
</div>

<p>Transplant the Oriental to the Occident, or in plain
words bring a nice-looking girl from the East to New
York, for instance, and nine times out of ten there is
sure to be something doing. Most of the doings, to be
sure, are under the rose, but every once in a while
some hint bobs to the surface and the news is wafted
about by every breeze of a whisper.</p>

<p>In his very handsomely appointed suite of apartments
on the upper West Side is a young fellow who
has good enough blood in his veins to be game and take
his medicine, and with sense enough to keep his mouth
shut. Across the bridge of his nose are three knife
cuts made by a blade that was very keen, which was
held by a hand that knew its business. His doctor
tells him that it is not at all serious, even though inconvenient—you
know how doctors talk when there
is a good fat fee at the other end of the line. He also
says that there is nothing in the world that will prevent
and eradicate those three disfiguring scars, even
after the wound has been thoroughly healed and every
possible surgical precaution taken.</p>

<p>And there’s the rub.</p>

<p>Through all the rest of his life this man, upon whom
the world has been smiling since his birth, will be
marked with the signs of his folly.</p>

<p>So much for the present.</p>

<p>Now for the recent past.</p>

<div id="illo_23" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img src="images/i_212.jpg" width="446" height="616" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Put her in tights and she would have been an Oriental sensation</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
The woman was a Syrian beauty with sloe eyes and
an olive skin that was like a piece of copper-hued satin,
so soft and smooth and free from blemish was it.
There was a faint flush of red in her cheeks, too, as if
the hot blood was trying to break through the tender
skin. Her lips were red and full, and because of all
that riot of color her teeth showed whiter than they
really were. She had, besides, small feet and slim,
trim ankles.</p>

<p>Any wise man will appreciate that and understand
why they are brought into this story. Up to the age
of twenty-five the male animal looks at the female
face and is satisfied. After that no such casual scrutiny
satisfies him. First face, hair and general contour,
then ankles, and often it is the last view which does
the work or turns the trick, which is the same thing,
only it is expressed differently. This is with the assumption,
of course, that the man has enough discrimination
to want quality, not quantity. Quantity is
unwieldy and unsatisfactory from every viewpoint
except from that of the gentleman who is in the
butcher business, and who wants a standing advertisement
for his shop. <em>Embonpoint</em> is all right in sausages
but not in women, excepting—and that is understood—those
on dime museum platforms.</p>

<p>The first name of the lady was Dekka, the rest was
unpronounceable and we’ll let it go at that. She was a
seller of Oriental goods, not from a Tenderloin standpoint,
but real merchandise such as is recognized by
the law—laces, draperies, bits of cunningly embroidered
silks, and even rugs, which she called carpets,
with the accent on the first syllable. Her stock was
carried in a dress suit case which was handled by her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
“brother,” who was also a Syrian, and he only resembled
her because he, too, had black eyes, an olive skin
and dark crispy hair, to say nothing of his small feet.</p>

<p>Day after day they went in and out of houses, flats
and apartments, visiting none but the best, and calling
an express wagon into service when a rug display was
necessary. She was the brains of the combination and
did all the selling. His job was done when he put the
satchel down by her side. Then he effaced himself and
was invisible until she was ready to exit, when he made
a mysterious reappearance from somewhere.</p>

<p>And that’s the soup of the story; the roast follows.</p>

<p>The Jap valet to the young man of means and leisure
announced to him one afternoon that a dark lady—makes
you think of the queen of spades, doesn’t it?—wanted
to see him and wouldn’t take no for an answer.</p>

<p>“Bring her in,” said Jimmy, who was feeling in just
the right kind of a humor to see anyone, even a man
to whom he owed money, and in a moment she had
slipped into the room as lightly as a cat walking on
wet grass. There was the sound of her French heels
hitting the bare spots on the polished floor that was
music to him, and he wondered what there was in the
meeting of leather and wood that was so attractive and
just a bit different from anything he had ever heard
before.</p>

<p>She courtesied in a friendly, intimate sort of a way,
and then spoke:</p>

<p>“Good day; the lady? Can I show her some laces?
Very fine.”</p>

<p>There was just the faintest touch of an accent in her
voice, but it was rather pleasant than otherwise, and it
seemed to have a very soothing effect on him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
“There is no lady here,” he laughed, “that is, not
yet.”</p>

<p>“Ah, too bad, and such a nice place, too. It is so
beautiful.”</p>

<p>She half turned as if to go, and he stepped toward
her.</p>

<p>“What have you got to sell? I might buy something.”</p>

<p>“You are so kind; I have them here,” and she motioned
to the next room. “My brother bring them, then
he go ’way. It is very heavy to carry all the time.”</p>

<p>“Yama,” called he, “bring it in, whatever it is,” and
in a moment the Jap came lugging the leather case.</p>

<p>Jimmy noted how deftly the shapely brown fingers
unfastened the brass catches, and as she leaned over
he found himself studying her with the eye of a man
who has seen and known a great many women of all
kinds and all nationalities with one or two exceptions,
and one of the exceptions was Syrian. A faint perfume,
the odor of which he failed to recognize, seemed
to fill the room, and he knew it came from her, and he
became suddenly aware that he was taking more interest
in the saleswoman than he was in the goods she
was about to offer him.</p>

<p>When the bag had been opened and the contents
tumbled out promiscuously, without any attempt at
order or display, she sat down on the rug beside them.
She picked out a lace scarf and carefully smoothing out
its folds held it before him.</p>

<p>“Very fine,” she said; “all made by hand, see?” and
she pointed to the heavy embroidery.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” he answered, but he wasn’t looking
at the silk, he was looking straight in her eyes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
wondering why it was he had never met a woman with
eyes as black as those before.</p>

<p>“You are not looking,” she said.</p>

<p>“I am,” he replied.</p>

<p>“At the scarf, I mean.”</p>

<p>“No, there is something better.”</p>

<p>“But I am only selling the scarf to you,” and she began
to fold it up while her cheeks became more red.</p>

<p>“What’s the price?” asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Only $6, and very cheap.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll take it; let me see what else you’ve
got there.”</p>

<p>And presently they were both sitting on the rug, he
on one side of the bag and she on the other. In a half
hour he had spent one hundred dollars, but to save his
life he couldn’t have told what it was he had bought
and, what was more, he didn’t care.</p>

<p>He laid the crisp new bill on her knee, and as she
began to fold up the remnant of her stock he asked
questions.</p>

<p>“You said your brother went around with you. Is
he really your brother or something else?”</p>

<p>“My own brother; why should I tell you a lie?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know except that there are a great many
brothers and cousins in this world who are not brothers
or cousins at all, except as a matter of convenience.
You know, I think you are a nice little girl and I fancy
I’m getting just a bit gone on you. I don’t mind buying
things from you, but I should like it if you and I
could be friends.”</p>

<p>By this time they were standing up; the suit case had
been closed and it was still between them, as if it was
a sort of a guardian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
“Couldn’t you stay here and have a little lunch with
me? We’ll have it right away and you’ll be away in an
hour. Where’s your brother?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he always waits somewhere—outside, maybe.”</p>

<p>“In the other room?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; sometimes in the hall and sometimes in the
street; sometimes he goes away and comes back again.”</p>

<p>“Well, this time he can wait a little longer. Yama,”
calling to the Jap, “get some lunch and hurry up.”</p>

<p>He picked up the barrier of a dress suit case and put
it one side, then he walked over to her and putting his
arm around her waist, pulled her toward him and
kissed her squarely on the mouth.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she cried, “what are you doing?”</p>

<p>“Kissing you. I’ve bought your silks and now I’m
ready to invest in kisses, and I find,” he remarked, as
he kissed her again, “that your kisses are the best.”</p>

<p>The blood leaped to his brain, and he held her so
tightly that it seemed as if he would crush her.</p>

<p>“You’ve made me fall in love with you,” he said, and
that strange Oriental perfume which came to him from
her seemed to make him mad. “I want you to go away
with me; will you? We’ll go wherever you like, and
you will not have to sell those things any more. You
can have all the money to spend that you want and
you will be a lady.”</p>

<p>Here was a picture strong enough to turn the head
of any woman, much less a Syrian straight from peasant
stock, brought into the world by accident, with a
face like a Madonna and with a supple, pliant figure
that made men turn around and look after her. A girl
who had known what privation and hardship was, and
who came of a race where women were born to be servants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
and made to wait on men, the masters. Her beauty
had brought her nothing and now it had suddenly become
an asset, a stock in trade of so great value that
for the rest of her life she would know neither work,
nor care, nor trouble. The blood rushing through her
veins made her dizzy and her head fell forward as her
eyes half closed. One brown arm crept up and around
the neck of this strong, broad-shouldered American,
and it kept her from falling to the floor in the excess
of her emotion. He felt her going, and picking her
up, carried her to the big armchair over in the corner,
where she cuddled up like a rabbit. She was clasping
and unclasping her fingers nervously as he stood looking
at her and her half-closed eyes never once met his.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he asked, bending over. “Can
I do anything for you?”</p>

<p>“No,” she whispered; “I was only thinking of my
brother.”</p>

<p>“You don’t want to mind him; he’s all right wherever
he is.”</p>

<p>“Not that, but he might not want—he might not like
you to—to love me,” and she looked up at him.</p>

<p>“We’ll take care of your brother all right. Because
he is your brother I will do what I can for him. Why,
I will——”</p>

<p>The voice of the Jap came from the other room just
as Jimmy was settling himself on the edge of the big
chair, and had his arm around the Syrian’s neck.</p>

<p>“No,” it said, “you wait; I see.”</p>

<p>There was an angry voice raised in expostulation,
and then before the man could move the brother came
bounding through the parted curtains. He paused for
just one brief moment and then shrieked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
“Dekka.” He said something else, too, but it was in
his own language and only the woman understood, but
whatever it was it made her shrink still lower in her
seat and cover her face with her hands. He was on
Jimmy like a cat, and three times, even though the
frightened Jap was trying to pull him off, he cut, and
each cut was across the bridge of the nose, and the
knife blade went as true and sure to the mark as
though it was in the hands of a surgeon on a patient
who was under ether. Then with one firm grip on
the wrist of the girl he dragged her to the door and
out, while the faithful Yama was using the silk scarfs—the
ones which had just been bought—trying to
staunch the flow of blood.</p>

<p>And that’s the story.</p>

<p>And the moral of it is that every man should stick to
his own race and his own blood, Caucasian to Caucasian
and Oriental to Oriental, for there are some
things in this world that don’t mix any more than oil
and water.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_23">THE REJUVENATION OF PATSY</h2>
</div>

<p>We’ll just take in a fight to-night for a change. I’ve
had you Down the Line, over on the East Side, in the
wine joints, behind the scenes, and in half a dozen of
the so-called swell restaurants, and all the time there
have been all kinds of punching matches going on in a
dozen different halls, “Clubs,” they are called, just
to sidestep the stern arm of the law, but what difference
does it make to a good sport so long as the men
are well matched and they are willing to mix it at all
times?</p>

<p>Three rounds are the limit, but there is a lot doing
between bell and bell—enough to make even the most
seasoned ringster sit up and look around as if to say:</p>

<p>“Now here is some punching that does a man’s heart
good—it seems like old times, when——.” You know
the rest about the days of long ago, and if you listen to
him he will hand you a line of talk that will put you
away for the count.</p>

<p>You may talk as you like about all the sports you
know, but after all there is nothing like a good go with
the gloves between a pair who know their business, and
there are few men who have any red blood in their
veins who will not go a long ways to see a slugfest.
Of course you’ll always find up against some bar
a bunch of dead ones who will stretch their arms
and say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
“Not for mine; I’ve seen all I want to see, and I
wouldn’t go around the corner to get a ringside seat at
a go between Roosevelt and Kaiser Wilhelm.”</p>

<p>There’s a screw loose somewhere in these fellows, or
else they are drying of dry rot and don’t know it. Nine
out of ten of them are bigger around the waist than
they are around the chest, and they invariably talk
loud.</p>

<p>There’s a little club that I know of where you can
get a great run for your money, and we will go there.</p>

<p>It’s a case of come early and avoid the rush, for
when the gong rings for the first bout there is only
standing room left and that is at a premium because
the prices are low. The manager doesn’t have to
bother his head about making matches because the
“talent” comes to him, and it often happens that the
men who furnish the preliminaries are picked from
out of the audience. These three-round affairs have
done a lot to bring out a bunch of new ones; any
young fellow who knows any part of the game can go
on and get a try-out. He earns a few dollars and if
he proves to be good, he is boosted along the line.</p>

<p>There is a mixed crowd on hand to-night, and you
can expect a good card. In one of the ringside seats
is the district attorney, a man who loves a fair fight in
or out of the ring. Further up are a few brokers who
have thought it worth while to come down here for
one night, anyhow. It is safe to say that every class
in life is represented, the man who is worth a million
rubs elbows with the ten-dollar-a-week clerk and they
fraternize as freely as though they were chums.</p>

<p>“This Abe Attell is a clever boy, but they say he
hasn’t the punch,” ventures the clerk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
“Yes, I saw him recently and he made that big
fellow look like a cart horse,” returns the man of
money.</p>

<p>The fellow who paid one-tenth of his weekly stipend
to join the club for that one night, which, by the way,
is the system employed to evade the law on the subject,
pulls out a cigarette, and asks:</p>

<p>“Can I trouble you for a light?”</p>

<p>“No trouble at all,” comes the cheerful answer, and
a glowing perfecto, which cost not less than thirty-five
cents, is handed over.</p>

<p>That miscellaneous crowd is welded into one solid
mass by the masonry of sport, even though individual
opinions are retained, and the opinion of a seasoned
ring-goer is set hard and deep as the rock of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The smoke is wafted back and forth like the tidal
currents of the sea and the exertions of a hundred
devotees of nicotine are adding to it every moment.
An interminable buzz of voices fills the big room, and
there is fight in the very air.</p>

<p>“I tell you the old man could lick O’Brien any day
he wanted to; he’s got the punch and he can stand the
gaff, ain’t that enough?” This in a strident voice from
the cheaper seats, and it was answered at once by
an argument that was apparently deemed irrefutable:</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he do it?”</p>

<p>Near the door is a fight bug whom no one ever heard
of, and who is interesting simply because he is a freak.
He is voluble, emphatic and vainglorious.</p>

<p>“I kin beat Britt an’ he knows it, an’ dat’s the reason
he won’t give me a chanst. He’d be a pipe fer me, ‘cos
I’d infight him, an’ he couldn’t stand my body punchin’.
Dere’s where I’m great—on dose body blows. I challenged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
him three times an’ he never paid no attention
to me. He’s afraid uv me, dat’s what he is. I kin
beat ’em all if dey’ll only cum to me.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t beat a carpet,” shouts a wit, and the
bug is temporarily squelched.</p>

<p>The noise of the voices is suddenly emphasized—the
first pair are coming and the show is on. Into the ring
they climb from opposite corners, principals and seconds,
and then, more leisurely, as befits the dignity
of his exalted position, comes the announcer. They
all have the same speech, which has been doing duty
for generations, and this one is no different from the
rest:</p>

<p>“A little order, please, gentlemen, and stop smoking
while the bouts are on.” But no one ever pays any
attention to that last. “These two boys,” he calls them
by name, “both members of this club,” another neat
little scheme to evade the law, “will box three rounds
for scientific points only. Keep a little order, please,
because if you make a noise the bouts will be stopped.
The men will box straight Marquis of Queensberry
rules. All ready, boys.”</p>

<p>He waves his hands toward the corners, and then
backs through the ropes conscious of a duty well performed.
The gloves, a bit too big for the majority of
the onlookers, have in the meantime been adjusted,
the referee calls “Time,” they step to the center, shake
hands and get down to work. Sparring doesn’t go in
bouts of such short duration, so it’s a case of mix it
from the start. Here is a sturdy little Italian against
a good, fast and clever Irish lad. The good-natured
grin of the former is never relaxed for a moment as
he wades in, taking a punch to give one. This fellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
is fighting his way out of debt, and he’s well on the
road to financial freedom now. Last year he figured
in more than one star fight and he looked like a money-maker.
He took care of his end of the purse every
time, but on one of his Southern trips he fell in with
a girl that he grew to think pretty well of, and it wasn’t
long before she became the custodian of his coin.
When the bank roll was big enough to suit her, she
blew with another boy and left this one broke. That’s
the reason he’s putting the gloves on and going three
hard rounds for a ten spot now. The Irish boy is
punching him at will and counting up the points every
time they come together, but there is steam behind
those blows of the Italian, and it isn’t hard to predict
the result if they were to go ten rounds instead of
three. At the finish they are furiously mixing it in a
corner, and the gong rings its notification more than
once before they break away, shake hands, the Italian
still smiling, and climb out to make way for the next
pair.</p>

<p>The boys are put on as fast as they can bring them
in the ring, and the bouts are all good ones. Finally
there is only one more to come, and it is that for which
the crowd has been waiting.</p>

<p>Before the announcer can do his next stunt half a
hundred hands—gloved and ungloved—are coming together
in applause. The cue came when a trim built,
muscular little fellow, whose condition is not too good,
slips through the ropes. He smiles cordially at the
crowd and nods his head jerkily in response to the
reception.</p>

<p>“I take pleasure in introducing Patsy Haley,” begins
the announcer, but he is stopped by the applause which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
breaks out again, and he fails to get in that saving
clause about the “club member” business. As if Patsy
needed any introduction to that crowd of sports, young
or old, who have seen him fight when he was at his
best. How can they ever forget the wonderful cleverness
he used to show? Don’t you remember when
he fought Terry McGovern before the Lenox Athletic
Club in 1899? It was all Patsy up to the eighteenth
round, and even the wonderful Terry couldn’t find him
until then, when he landed the crashing punch that
gave him the big end of the purse. Is it any wonder
that they applaud him? He’s too wise for the best
of them for three rounds even to-day, for he can stall
and get away with as little effort as a kid makes when
he goes up against a nursing bottle. He hits when
and where he likes and how he likes, but he has no
punch, as the youngster who is up against him soon
finds out, and so he wades in to do a little execution
with a wild, swinging right, but the glove never gets
within three inches of Patsy’s smiling face. It is jab,
jab, jab with the old-timer, and the crowd roars its
approval, while the Kid’s seconds keep calling to him
in stage whispers which can be heard all over the
house, <span class="locked">to—</span></p>

<p>“Mix it there, Kid, one punch will do him.”</p>

<p>Their advice is good, but the bewildered, dazed kid,
not hurt a bit, but simply made dizzy by those lightning-like
feints, followed by taps that push his head
back and throw him off his balance, can’t make good.
He rushes, swinging as he comes in, but he finds himself
breasting the ropes, and he turns only to get a
straight left square on the point of the nose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
It’s very discouraging work for a novice. You see,
he’s evidently been figuring on going into the ring and
putting this old-timer away and then getting his name
and picture in the sporting papers. It’s a hundred
to one that he’s been in training, and he’s had it
all framed up with his trainer just how he was going
to do the trick. It seemed very easy in that stable, or
loft, or wherever it was that he had his punching bag
and skipping rope, and he was told there was no harm
in a dozen of Patsy’s punches rolled into one. He
knows that now, but that merciless, pitiless jab is
enough to worry anyone, and besides, his arms are beginning
to ache with the effort of swinging and hitting
nothing.</p>

<p>“Close in, Kid; close in.”</p>

<p>They are calling to him again and he makes another
rush. He is going to try to knock the smile off that
face this time. He puts all his effort in the blow and
lets go. He misses, and the force of it brings him to
his knees as the bell rings for the end of the first round.</p>

<p>He takes his seat and he knows that those yells are
not for him.</p>

<p>His seconds and counsellors are there as quickly as
he is, and while he is being fanned, and rubbed and
sprayed, he is also being advised how to do it next
time. Over in the other corner Patsy is talking laughingly
with some ringside friends.</p>

<p>“You’re as fast as ever, son,” says one. “How are
you feeling?”</p>

<p>That is always the proper thing to ask a man who is
in the ring—that is, when you’ve nothing else to say.
I’ll bet no man ever went in the ring who wasn’t asked
that question at least a dozen times. It seems to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
sort of a stock query, just as every rube considers it his
bounden duty to ask an actor who plays his town:</p>

<p>“Where do you go from here?” As if it made any
difference to him where the actor went, but he feels he
has to say something, so he says that.</p>

<p>The gong rings, and they’re at it again. The Kid
has a new set of tactics now, and he proceeds to put
them into execution, so as soon as he leaves his chair
he starts on a run for his opponent. He’s going after
him this time, sure enough. Out goes the left and
around goes the right. The right gets Patsy just behind
the ear and shakes him up a bit.</p>

<p>“Go after him; you’ve got him,” call out the seconds.
He thinks so, too, and he draws back when the
versatile Patsy slips into a clinch.</p>

<p>“Break there; break now,” calls the referee. The
Kid is pushed away and his antagonist dances back
out of reach, not showing the slightest evidence of distress.
Truly this is no cinch. Again and again an attempt
is made to land that finishing punch, but each
time it fails to connect, and when it does land it doesn’t
seem to land in the right place. In a mixup his chance
comes again, and he rips up a right to the stomach so
hard that the old-timer grunts. That gives him a little
courage and after the break he rushes again, but the
jaw that he aimed for is not there. His nose is beginning
to get a bit sore when the bell rings with rather a
welcome sound.</p>

<p>Lacking the punch this “vet” seems to be all right
for three rounds. He’s a bit winded, to be sure, but
who wouldn’t be under the circumstances? It’s good,
anyhow, to see him with the mitts on once more. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
makes a fellow think of old times. I am just about to
become reminiscent when the gong rings again.</p>

<p>“Shake hands and windup,” says the referee.</p>

<p>The padded fists meet for an instant, the Kid steps
back one pace and then lunges forward. He comes in
with a jab, and he catches Haley squarely on the mouth
with his left. Aha, he has landed. He pulls his right
back to follow it up, but in that fraction of a second
his chance has gone, for he’s up against a ring general.
Two more futile rushes and then he tried again. This
time he misses with the left, but starting his right without
pulling back, he catches his man on the jaw just in
front of the ear. He feels the blow land and then he
starts in with rights and lefts, but shifty Patsy steps
inside of them and they go around his neck. In a
frenzy the Kid pushes him away, but for his trouble he
gets another jab on that sore nose that brings the moisture
to his eyes.</p>

<p>“Make him fight, Kid,” bawls the trainer; “go after
him.”</p>

<p>He might as well go after a dancing sunbeam as to
go after the elusive, shifty, smiling Patsy, who is
stalling and jabbing the third round away, and when
the final gong rings he is still going after him with
nothing doing. There is bitterness in his heart, but it
doesn’t last, for when they shake hands, the little fellow
who made many a good one in his day look like
a draught horse, remarks:</p>

<p>“You’re all right, Kid, and you’ll beat a lot of them
some day.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_24">A CASE OF KNOCKOUT DROPS</h2>
</div>

<p>In a back room of a place just off Broadway sat a
good-looking brunette—you will notice all these girls
of mine are good looking—and three young fellows of
the kind known to the police as “cadets.” There was
nothing unusual about this room except that it was
better furnished than you would have expected, and it
had expensive oil paintings on the walls. Besides, it
was carpeted. All this would mean higher-priced
drinks if not a better service.</p>

<p>It was a drinking place where women might come
with their escorts and feel reasonably safe from intrusion,
and midnight was its busiest hour. Just now was
the calm which precedes the storm, and there were
not enough guests to induce the waiters to cease their
gossiping and loafing in the big room outside.</p>

<p>The woman who sat there at the little round table
was a common type; you can see her like wherever
you go, especially at night. When the sun has gone
down and the lights are bright, she flutters out of
some cave-like dwelling like a new kind of butterfly,
with the instincts of the moth, in that she flutters only
at night, and in her veins runs the blood of a hunter,
for she is ever on the trail.</p>

<p>This one is pretty in a negative sort of way. Her
features are regular, her teeth are white and strong,
and her eyes are bright and have expression, but if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
will look close you will notice a hard glance there.
It is neither merciful nor kind.</p>

<p>She has emotions, but they are hardly worth considering,
for they are of the baser sort.</p>

<p>She has nerve, daring, courage and calmness, and
because her life has been a constant warfare she fears
nothing. She may dread the touch of a policeman’s
hand and the command to “Come on,” but she doesn’t
fear it. There is a difference, you know, between the
words of fear and dread.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that she was born to be what she is.</p>

<p>Her first adventure in life was when she became infatuated
with the glitter of the arena, and with a girl
companion of her own age took up with a couple of
clowns attached to a circus. But she soon found the
difference between the dressing tents and reserved
seats and headed for the nearest big city.</p>

<p>“There ain’t a case note among the four of us,” remarks
one of the men. “I think we’re a bunch of
shines. The first thing you know we’ll have to go out
and look for jobs.”</p>

<p>The girl was drumming idly on the table with her
fingers.</p>

<p>“You’re the strongest one of the lot, what’s the matter
with you making a start?” said another to the one
who had just spoken.</p>

<p>“I’d look nice getting up with the milk wagons,
wouldn’t I?”</p>

<p>The girl stopped her drumming and glanced up.</p>

<p>“You can leave me out of all this argument,” she remarked,
“for I don’t figure. No more Broadway for
mine after ten o’clock to-night, and it’s a case of good-by
for you, too, Jack.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
“I suppose that’s another one of your funny jokes,”
said Jack, “but I don’t like those kind of stories, so
you can cut it out.”</p>

<p>“No funny story about it at all,” she went on, in that
even, monotonous way which is particularly aggravating.
“I’m tired of this way of living, and I’m tired of
being a coaling station, and I know when I got
enough.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p>She had resumed her drumming and paid no attention.</p>

<p>“Who are you going with?”</p>

<p>“That’s none of your damned business.”</p>

<p>He leaned forward and taking her by the wrist gave
her a vicious pull toward him.</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s that guy from the country?”</p>

<p>“Well, what if it is?” she said defiantly, and then, as
if she had suddenly made up her mind, she went on,
talking rapidly, as a woman will do when she is under
a nervous strain:</p>

<p>“He’s going to do what you never thought of doing—he’s
going to marry me and make me decent—if it
ain’t too late. He’s going to meet me here at ten
o’clock and we’re going to jump to the Coast. He’s
got the coin, for he’s sold out his farm. He’s going to
take me out there, and he says we are going to begin
all over again; that I’ll have a good chance, for nobody
will know where I came from. What do I get here?
Nothing. If I’m sick I can go to the hospital or die in
my room like a rat in a garret. I haven’t a friend in
the world who would do anything for me on the level
and for pure friendship’s sake. If I was to grow old
to-morrow, I couldn’t get enough to buy a cup of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
coffee, and of all the good fellows I know there is only
one who would walk across the street to do anything
for me just because he liked me. You’re broke now,
and you are wondering how you are going to get money,
but you know down in your heart that you’re expecting
me to get it for you. You’ve got a long wait,
for I’ll not get it. I’m through, and that settles it.”</p>

<p>“So you’ve been meeting this fellow on the quiet,
have you?” asked the one who was called Jack.</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t seen him for five years.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think you can kid me; how have you been
framing things up then if you haven’t been meeting
him?”</p>

<p>She gazed at him steadily for a moment as if she
were shaping her course, and then she said:</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll just put you right for once. I suppose
you’ve heard of the mail. Well, I’ve been getting letters
from him, and here,” pulling one from a little
handbag she carried, “is the last one.”</p>

<p>With a quick, deft movement he snatched it from
her hand and opened it. At the first line he laughed
loudly.</p>

<p>“He’s nutty, all right—he must have it bad. Listen
to him:”</p>

<p>He began to read.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Little Girl</span>:—I have just received your
letter, and the world looks different to me already. I
don’t want you to tell me any more about yourself, for
I don’t want to know any more. We have nothing to
do with the past now, it is only the future which concerns
us and that will be what we make it. I have sold
the old farm, so we have $12,000 to start with, and I
shall be in New York at the place you suggest and on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
time to the minute, so you can look for me. Don’t
bother about baggage or any of your personal belongings,
for all we will want is a minister. After that
we can talk things over. I hate to leave the old place,
but it makes no difference now that I’m going to have
you.</p>

<p class="sigright">
Yours always, <span class="in6 smcap">Joe</span>.
</p>

<p>He handed the letter back to her.</p>

<p>“Little girl, you’re all right after all, ain’t she, fellows?
Landed a guy with $12,000 in cold coin, and
he’ll have the goods on him, too, I suppose. We won’t
do a thing but take that bank roll away and send him
back to the farm again.”</p>

<p>Then he turned to the girl.</p>

<p>“How’s the best way to do it? Give him the peter?
Maybe it will be best to take him up to the room and
wait till he gets asleep. It’s your job, Maude, so we’ll
do as you say. It’s only nine o’clock, and we’ve got
an hour yet to frame it up.”</p>

<p>She was looking at him with horror in her face.</p>

<p>“You’re wrong,” she cried, “he’s not to be trimmed.
He’s going to marry me and we are going away.
There’s no job about this, and I want you to leave him
alone.”</p>

<p>“We’ll leave him alone all right, and when you see
the new front on me to-morrow you’ll think I own
Broadway. Twelve thousand dollars, why, the four
of us can go to Europe on that.”</p>

<p>Then she stood up.</p>

<p>“If you touch him or try to turn him off I’ll call in a
cop and have you all pinched,” and she swept her hand
at them with an inclusive movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
“Don’t go off your nut like that, everything will be
all right,” said Jack. “You’ll get your bit, no matter
what happens, but you’re talking like a crazy woman.
You never used to be like this. You’ve been in tougher
jobs before. You just think you’re stuck on this Joe
because he writes you a nice letter, but there’s nothing
to it. You stick to me and I’ll stick to you, and this
bundle will put us on Easy Street. Why don’t you be
nice?”</p>

<p>She had partly turned her back on them and was
looking at one of the pictures on the wall.</p>

<p>It is when a woman is silent that she is most dangerous,
because then she is thinking. Give a woman time
to think and you are simply supplying her with ammunition.
But the stupid man who had dominated by
brute force knew nothing of this. To him her silence
meant acquiescence, and he scented an easy victory.</p>

<p>With a quick, alert nod of his head he motioned the
other two from the room, and they left silently and like
automatons, their feet on the carpet giving forth no
sound, but her senses were keen and she knew when
they had gone. As the door closed behind them she
turned around with a smile on her face.</p>

<p>“I think,” she said, “that you will be a fool as long
as you live. Here I find a man with a big roll, and arrange
to have him bring it to us on a gold plate and
you turn around, make me give my hand away, and
declare those two dead ones in on the play. You’ll
never have sense if you live to be a hundred years old.”</p>

<p>He looked at her admiringly.</p>

<p>“You’re better than I thought,” he said at last.
“We’ll jump to Europe on this. Wait ’till I get a paper
and see if there is a ship sailing to-morrow morning.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
We’ll make a quick getaway from the whole crowd.”</p>

<p>He almost ran through the door in his eagerness.</p>

<p>He was back in a few moments with a newspaper in
his hand. Eagerly he scanned the columns devoted to
shipping news.</p>

<p>“Good,” he ejaculated, “there’s one goes to France.
Sails at nine o’clock. We’ll head for Paris—there’s the
place to buy your clothes; swell, too, and cheap; and
we won’t take anything with us, we’ll buy it all there.”</p>

<p>“Get down to cases,” she said sharply. “How are
you going to do this?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got the peter drops,” he said, putting his hand
to his pocket. “That’ll be the easiest way. We’ll just
dope him a bit, grab the money, get out quick, and lay
low somewhere until to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“You know best,” she said, but her voice had a
strained tone in it that escaped him. “But whatever
you do, whenever I give you any kind of a tip take it
quick, see.”</p>

<p>Even as she spoke the door was pushed open and a
well-built, brown-faced young fellow strode in, looked
around, paused irresolutely, and then went toward her
with a smile on his face and his hand outstretched.</p>

<p>“You see, I’m on time, Maude,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, Joe, and I’ve been waiting for you a long
while. This is a friend of mine who has been very
good to me, and I want you to know him. His name
is Jack. That’s been enough for me and I guess it will
be enough for you.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have one drink, and then I’ll have to be getting
along,” said Jack, briskly.</p>

<p>The other didn’t drink, but the coaxing of the girl
made him almost forget his name, and three glasses of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
whiskey were ordered from the man who came at the
summons of the bell.</p>

<p>They were about to drink when she suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe, here’s a picture that always makes me
think of the old days; see, that one with the lake,” and
as Joe looked the other man deftly poured the dose into
the waiting glass. She saw it done and nodded her approval,
and then, while they were still talking about
the picture, she asked Jack to get her a pencil so she
could write a note. In little affairs of this kind strict
obedience to an order is absolutely necessary, so he did
not question her, but went at once.</p>

<p>When he returned they were sitting at the table
again.</p>

<p>“Now for our last drink together,” she remarked
gayly, “and here’s that we may all be happy,” and she
looked at Jack.</p>

<p>And so they drank, and then Jack set himself to
watching furtively out of the corner of his eye this
man with the money. He fell to wondering just where
it was, and turned cold at the thought that it might
have been left at some place for safe keeping. Once
his eyes closed and he opened them with an effort. The
girl said something, and it took him some little time
before his brain could figure out what he ought to say
in reply, and longer still for his lips to form the words.
She was talking rapidly, but her voice seemed a great
distance away.</p>

<p>“Come on, Joe,” he heard that all right. “Come on,
it’s time we were going. We must hurry.”</p>

<p>It didn’t seem at all strange to him that they should
want to hurry; in fact, it seemed quite natural.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
“If he’s a friend of yours we ought not to leave him
here like that.” That was the man’s voice, he could
swear to that.</p>

<p>“Come on,” she said again, and for hours afterward
it was as if the world was filled with women shouting
“come on, come on,” to tall, athletic young fellows with
blue eyes and brown faces, and the incessant murmur
of it all made his head ache.</p>

<p>Then he was being violently handled by someone
who appeared to be intent upon annoying him and
causing his head to hurt still worse.</p>

<p>He was slapped and walked, and a strange, queer
liquid was being forced between his teeth.</p>

<p>Then he opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“You’re all right now, I guess,” said a man’s unfamiliar
voice.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he asked thickly.</p>

<p>“Nothing much, only you’ve been drugged and your
heart came near quitting. Lie down now and rest up
a bit and you’ll be all right after a while.”</p>

<p>“Where the devil am I?” he asked, after the manner
of the abducted girl in the society drama.</p>

<p>“You’re in the hospital—you ought to be glad you’re
alive.”</p>

<h2 id="hdr_25">DISCOVERING A PRIMA DONNA</h2>
</div>

<p>The great see-saw of life is as interesting as a poker
game if you only have a mind to watch it, but, like the
poker game, it must be thoroughly understood and
closely studied to appreciate the fine points. In the
beginning we all take cards, we all draw to fill; the
winning hands slip easily through life, while the four
flushes try to bluff it out, and there’s many a four
flush in New York to-day who is getting away with it.</p>

<p>Many a girl who wears a sailor hat never saw a
yacht, and many a man who wears a diamond pin
couldn’t pay fifty cents on the dollar if it came to a
show down.</p>

<p>But that isn’t the story by any means.</p>

<p>I call this little recital of facts the beginning and the
end; you’ll see why later as the plot thickens.</p>

<p>New York with the lid on is New York just the
same, no matter what the police say. It’s all there,
only it is covered up a bit.</p>

<p>The shades are pulled closer, but the lights and
everything else are behind them.</p>

<p>The wild revelry of the masked ball is toned down
not one jot, and the perfect ladies in tights who help
to make life endurable for the sports on these occasions
do not add, so far as can be seen, even so much
as one piece of jewelry to their scant costumes.</p>

<p>You may never have seen the kind of room I’m
going to introduce to you, but if you haven’t it’s your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
fault, for they are common enough, not only in New
York, but in many other cities.</p>

<p>There’s space enough for dancing here, and the
floor is polished like glass. Around the sides are round
tables for the drinkers, and they are the most important
feature, for if you don’t drink, or at least order
drinks, you had better skiddoo, for you’ll not have a
very pleasant time.</p>

<p>At one end of the room is an orchestra, consisting
of a piano and a violin. I don’t need to call your attention
to the fact that the fellow who is playing the
violin knows his business. You can tell that by the
way he handles his instrument. He never learned
that touch out of a book, nor did he acquire that technique
at the rate of ten lessons for a dollar, cash in advance.
A few years before he was playing nocturnes
and sonatas before fashionable audiences for big
money, but he hit the slide and now he’s at the bottom—a
dollar a night and drinks for ragtime.</p>

<p>The hands on the clock which mark the flight of
time show exactly midnight, and business is at high
tide. It’s a case of get the money between now and
three o’clock and then slow down, and every aggressive
waiter in the place is hustling as if his life depended
on it.</p>

<p>A girl is standing at the piano as the orchestra
strikes the introduction of a song. Not a bad-looking
girl if you observe her closely. Rather a strong face,
good, honest blue eyes, set well apart, and a chin in
which there is some hint of determination and self-reliance.
She has a trim little figure, not voluptuous,
but good to look at—the kind of a figure that seems to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
belong in an evening gown, and which men turn
around to look at.</p>

<p>The only thing that stamps her as an habitue of the
place is her dress. Its gaudiness was made for the
night. It is a street beacon which proclaims at every
step, “follow me.” The picture hat, with the sweeping
red feather, heightens the effect. It is all very stagey,
and would look as garish as spangles in the honest
light of day.</p>

<p>But this is not a daylight scene, so we’ll let that
pass.</p>

<p>“Ha, there, you noisy guys, cut out that chinnin’;
Little Melba’s goin’ ter sing. Cheese it.”</p>

<p>It is the strident voice of a waiter that admonishes
a noisy party at one of the tables, and it has an immediate
effect.</p>

<p>It’s just as well, you know, to pay a little attention
to the advice of a waiter in a place like this.</p>

<p>And so she sings her song.</p>

<p>It is a refrain with a swing to it, and it tells the story
of a man and a woman in a rather affecting way, and
for her loyalty to him, the man calls the woman his
pal.</p>

<p>But the words don’t count here; it’s the voice, and
you’ll see why they call her Little Melba. Every note
is true and clear, and there is never a falter at the high
ones.</p>

<p>It doesn’t need a waiter to command order now; the
first line of that song, as sung by her, did more than
all the waiters in the world could do.</p>

<p>It commanded the respectful attention of that mixed
mob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
At the finish of the first chorus, a sailor in the exuberance
of his admiration, and feeling that he must
give voice to his sentiments in some tangible manner,
roared out:</p>

<p>“You’re all right, old pal; you’re all right.”</p>

<p>She smiled at the compliment, nodded at him in a
friendly way, and then she continued.</p>

<p>Every night she sang there—ten songs—and she was
paid exactly the same as the waiters—one dollar, but
she received in addition certain privileges, the details
of which need not be entered into here, because they
have nothing to do with the story.</p>

<p>One of the waiters—the one who had called out for
order—was her man. She called him another name,
and he was known to the world by still another. As a
matter of fact, although he didn’t know it, he belonged
to her—although he thought she belonged to him—for
the clothes that he wore were bought with her money,
the food that he ate she paid for, and it was she who
rented the place which he called home. She was the
bread winner, she bore the burden of life, and she
took the blows. The police kept their eyes on her, but
paid no attention to the man—the real criminal.</p>

<p>As the last notes of her song forced their way
through the clouds of tobacco smoke, three men in
evening dress came in. They were of the usual kind
of visitors from which the waiters always expect a
wine order. They wore evening clothes like men who
had been used to them all their lives, and it didn’t need
the sharp eyes of a waiter in a tough resort like this to
detect that air of prosperity which invariably forms an
invisible halo about money.</p>

<p>The square-jawed, square-shouldered young fellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
who took the order was not disappointed. It was wine,
and as he uncorked the bottle, full of a sense of his
own importance, one of them asked, casually:</p>

<p>“Who is the lady who was singing as we came in?”</p>

<p>“Little Melba; she’s there with de goods, all right,
ain’t she?”</p>

<p>“Tell her to come over here and have a drink.”</p>

<p>“Sure. Ha, Melba, you’re wanted over here,” he
bawled, and smilingly she came.</p>

<p>“Will you have a drink?” asked the man who had
sent for her.</p>

<p>“Wine?” she queried, “I’d rather have a glass of
beer, if it’s all the same to you, for I’m thirsty enough
to drink a keg. Then me for the wine afterward.”</p>

<p>After her drink had been ordered and she had tossed
it off with the air of one who is well used to it, she
remarked:</p>

<p>“Now I’ll hit a little of that fizz, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been singing here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, about six months. It’s a bum job, though. The
smoke gets in my throat.”</p>

<p>“What songs do you sing?”</p>

<p>She ran over a list that took in all the popular melodies
of the day.</p>

<p>“Here’s a dollar, get up and sing another one—anyone
will do, and do your best.”</p>

<p>Dollars for singing one song were rare for her, so
she obeyed with alacrity, and she sang as best she knew.</p>

<p>When she had finished she came back to where they
were sitting just as one of the men was saying:</p>

<p>“Why don’t you give her a chance, Jim? You can
never tell how these kind will turn out. Remember
Elinore was dug up out of just such a joint as this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
“Do you want to go on the stage?” asked Jim,
abruptly.</p>

<p>“Do I?” and she unconsciously straightened up.
“Why, I’d go on for nothing, just to show them I could
make good. Say, I’d work for my board. Can you
put me on?”</p>

<p>“I think I can,” and smiled as he said it.</p>

<p>He pulled a card case out of his vest pocket, took a
card from it, which he handed to her.</p>

<p>“Come see me to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock.”</p>

<p>She looked at the name on the card and gasped in
astonishment, for it was that of one of the best-known
of metropolitan theatrical managers, whose chief claim
to fame lay in the many successful productions of
comic opera.</p>

<p>“Are you on the level with this?” she asked, incredulously.</p>

<p>“Come around to-morrow and see,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Put it there,” she said, excitedly, as she held out
her hand, and then she called out to the waiter to whom
she believed she owed her allegiance:</p>

<p>“Billy, Billy, come over here.”</p>

<p>With a roll and a swagger, and not too hurriedly,
lest he lose one tithe of that dignity which he believed
went with the position of beer slinger in one of the
toughest joints in New York, Billy came, scowling, as
if he already scented in the air coming interference
with his plans of life.</p>

<p>“See, Billy,” she said, laughing like a little girl with
the joy of it all. “See, this is the great theatre manager,
and he’s going to give me a show to see what I
can do. I’m going on the stage, Billy, in a regular
theatre, and sing before the people. Ain’t it great?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
She was like a child in her enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Come on, let me blow the crowd: what are you going
to have, boys?” this last with a comprehensive
sweep of the hands. “I’m buying now.”</p>

<p>Billy stood looking down on her with a scowl.</p>

<p>“What’s all dis?” he asked. “What’s comin’ off here,
and me not in on de play?”</p>

<p>Then he turned to the manager.</p>

<p>“What are yer doing—givin’ me gal a jolly, ha?
Well, cut it out, it don’t go here, see? Don’t let ’em
string yer, Melba. I guess de’re a bunch of pretty flip
guys wid all dere glad rags; what?”</p>

<p>“This ain’t no string, Billy, this is all right, ain’t
it, Mister?” and she appealed to the man who had been
talking to her.</p>

<p>“It’s all right as far as I am concerned,” was the
answer. “You do as I say, and if you have any ambition,
I guess you’ll get along all right.”</p>

<p>“Do as you say?” queried the waiter, scornfully.
“You ain’t no Pierpont Morgan. What’s de matter
wid her doin’ as I say once in er while. Do yer t’ink
I’m a dummy wot ain’t got no voice? I guess nit. Just
cut all dis funny business out and leave my gal alone.”</p>

<p>“Take it easy, Billy, and don’t get excited. This is a
chance for me, don’t you see? What’s the good of
staying here and losing my voice for a dollar a night
when I might be getting big money in the theatre?”</p>

<p>“Big money nothin’,” he protested. “Ain’t yer on
dat it’s only a stall? Dis guy is stuck on yer, dat’s it.
He wants to win yer away from me.”</p>

<p>The three wise men who had been drinking wine
rose to their feet just as any other three wise men
would have done under the circumstances. It doesn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
pay to get mixed up with a waiter in a tough joint, because
the waiter always gets the best of it—that’s why
he is a waiter. He has a lot to do besides serving
drinks, and if he wasn’t handy with his fists, and feet,
too, for that matter, he couldn’t hold his place for more
than a night.</p>

<p>As they started for the door the girl stood up.</p>

<p>“I’ll be there to-morrow, all right,” she called out.</p>

<p>“Over my dead body you will,” came Billy’s voice.</p>

<p>They were out of the door by this time, too late to
hear the sound of a blow and too late to see the girl
drop to the floor.</p>

<p>They don’t interfere in those kind of family rows in
the Tenderloin, or in the Bowery, either.</p>

<p>It isn’t healthy.</p>

<p>It’s etiquette to mind your own business and keep
out of the way. And so nobody paid any attention to
the weeping girl and the swearing blackguard. But
that night in a dingy room a girl cried herself to sleep,
and between her tears made up her mind what she
would do on the morrow.</p>

<p>She did what she had planned to do, and twenty-four
hours later the tough waiter was looking for another
girl to take her place.</p>

<p>Between you and me, that happened a long while
ago, as we count time in New York. Since then she has
been abroad, to the Pacific Coast and in all of the
large American cities. Her name is in big type on
the posters, and she is referred to as a prima donna.</p>

<p>I wonder if her memory ever takes her back to the
little back room where she used to sing songs for a
dollar a night?</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_26">A THROW OF THE DICE</h2>
</div>

<p>There is probably no street in the world that has
the same number and style of restaurants as Broadway,
New York, especially the kind that are within the
bounds of the Tenderloin. Chuck Conners would call
them feed joints; the irreverent might refer to them
as hash houses, and the slangy man or woman who
wanted to designate them might be pardoned for dubbing
them lobster palaces. But there would be a lot of
sense and reason in the last if you were only on, or took
the time to think it over.</p>

<p>There is nothing to them in the daytime, and the
heavily carpeted floors and snowy-clad tables burdened
with silver and glass are practically out of commission.
There are a few waiters on duty, but no one ever heard
of them being overworked, even with the rush of the
merry-merry after a matinee.</p>

<p>These money-makers begin to rouse up a bit about
the time the average man of business affairs is finishing
his quiet dinner at home, but the time to go there
if you want to see things, and by things I mean the
sights and celebrities, is after the theatres have let
out the evening performance. Then, if you amount to
anything, you will have a table where you can see and
be seen, and you will feast upon a bite that will cost
you nothing less than a ten-dollar bill, not including
wine.</p>

  <div class="caption">It’s only a dream after the lobster course</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
The shining lights of this world are in a class by
themselves, and include the bookmaker with a loud
voice—a trifle heavier than his bank roll; the gambler,
soft of hand and manner; the sport who has done
something or other at some time or other to entitle him
to a passing recognition; the detective sergeant, who
is a necessary evil, and who mixes in for business purposes
of his own, and not for the purpose of doing the
work for which he is paid by the city; then, last of all,
the actor—star or semi-star.</p>

<p>They order as if the cooks in all the world were
working for them alone, and the waiters were employed
for their exclusive benefit. They are epicures
and gourmets by force of circumstances, and the circumstances
are a roll of bank bills about the size of a
man’s wrist. Most of them have risen to a mushroom-like
affluence.</p>

<p>The money came quickly, and they are spending it
just as quickly.</p>

<p>They know the difference in wines simply because of
the price, and they order that which sounds the best,
so for that reason a stream of the juice of the grape
floods a bunch of uneducated palates and floats high-priced
food that would kill a man with an ordinary
digestive apparatus.</p>

<p>Not one in a hundred of these men were to the
manor born; their lives were cast in stony places and
what they are they made themselves by sheer force of
will, or else they accepted the golden wreath of opportunity
and knew which road to take when they came
to the forks.</p>

<p>At a table near the wall is a man who twenty years
ago was a bootblack of the city’s streets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
From river to river there was no spot on which he
could put his finger and say:</p>

<p>“This is my home.”</p>

<p>He grew up like a blade of grass sprouting between
stones, and he fought tooth and nail for his life. He
knew what kicks and cuffs were, and if his memory
isn’t bad he knows yet.</p>

<p>He blacked the boots of a man with florid face, a
heavy gold chain across his vest, and a mammoth
stone blazing like a headlight in his scarf, and because
this boy was bright of eye and keen of wit his customer,
whose business was politics, took a fancy to
him. Had this little nomad been born with a gold
spoon in his mouth he could not have fared better,
nor could his prospects have been more alluring, for a
politician, you know, is a man who, when he goes to
bed at night, hangs his trousers on the bedpost, and
when he wakes up in the morning the pockets are full
of money. At least, that is my idea, and if I am wrong
just let some of the leading politicians of to-day contradict
me, and tell me truly how they got theirs.</p>

<p>While this man is eating his lobster a la Newburg,
and sipping the wine that cost him $5 a bottle, I’ll go
on with the story.</p>

<p>For about two weeks he blacked his patron’s shoes,
and then one fateful morning the man with the bull
neck said sharply:</p>

<p>“Chuck that box away, son, and come along with
me.”</p>

<p>He didn’t wait for the boy to take the cue and act on
it, but he gave the box a kick with his square-toed boot
that sent it to the middle of the street, and then he led<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
the boy to a clothing shop where he had him fitted out
with everything a fellow that size ought to have.</p>

<p>He saw possibilities in this youngster, and he figured
that it would be a wise move to have some one as close
to him as his shirt, and upon whom, in time of trouble,
he could depend with absolute certainty.</p>

<p>A good bed, good food three times a day and money
in the pocket serves often to make a marvelous transformation,
and it was so in this case, and the erstwhile
bootblack forgot in a moment that he had ever shined
shoes or performed any menial services for any human
being. He was swept along on the tide of prosperity
with his patron and he scoffed at poor things and poor
people, as might have been expected. He was aggressive
to everyone except his source of income, whom he
followed and fawned upon like a hound.</p>

<p>The work he did was criminal, but he did it cheerfully,
even though a hundred could have sent him up
the river with a word. His morals were as flat as a
desert, and he grew into a selfish, egotistical, arrogant,
blatant man whose friends were friends by force of
circumstances, and not by reasons of any virtues that
he possessed, or of any real liking they had for him.</p>

<p>In the course of time the big man with the neck of a
gladiator died, and was buried in a manner fitting his
life. A ton of flowers followed him to the six-foot hole
which had been provided for him; a few bottles of
wine were drunk by his cronies to drown their grief
and to toast his successful debut into that new and unknown
world to which he had gone, and that was all.</p>

<p>The bootblack, who had taken himself seriously, and
was fond of calling himself a gentleman on all possible
occasions, for no other reason apparently than that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
wore the best clothes that money could buy, took possession
of his patron’s effects, rifled his safe, his desk,
and appropriated to himself everything that was of
the slightest value, and then developed into a short
card man.</p>

<p>So he sits there to-night, eating lobster and talking
to a woman who, between you and me, is worth looking
at more than once.</p>

<p>By an old and familiar, as well as extremely simple,
process she had taken his name. It was a trifling matter,
settled in a moment over a small bottle, and her
only speculation was as to whether he could suitably
provide for her.</p>

<p>It was a very good investment for him, for she has
proven to be a very useful little lady in more ways than
one. She knows a lot of real nice boys, and when they
get very sporty she tells them about a good game where
good fellows may be found. She is the kind of a
woman who would make a sport out of a church
deacon, consequently she fits very snugly into the life
and trade of our friend the shoe-shiner.</p>

<p>When you get to know her passing well she will tell
you how she was educated in a convent, which she left
to visit a wealthy aunt in Pittsburg. While there she
became engaged to marry a rich broker, and so on,
and so on, you know, the same old story. The stage
figures in it, too, because there is always a fascinating
glamor about the other side of the footlights.</p>

<p>She has been in comic opera and she has a lot of expensive
photographs of herself in theatrical poses, but
no matter how well posted you may be you fail to recall
her name, even though she was an understudy for
Lillian Russell, “when Lillian was good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
If you let your glance rove across the room to a
table close by one of the central pillars, you will see
another type of woman, and this one is worth studying.</p>

<p>She will never see her fortieth birthday again, although
she looks about thirty-two. That may be art,
or it may be an inherited physical characteristic, but
the fact remains that she is still young enough and
good looking enough to attract a man.</p>

<p>She is a veritable star and her singing and acting are
flawless.</p>

<p>The fine old gentleman she is chatting with is the
head of a very ancient and very distinguished family
of New York, and she is under his protecting wing.</p>

<p>That is a remarkable feature of her career; she always
selects with painstaking care, nice old men, with
families.</p>

<p>And for that there may be a good and sufficient reason.</p>

<p>While you are watching her and noting her rather
dainty ways, which are perhaps a bit too dainty for one
of her age, listen to the little story I am going to tell
you about her.</p>

<p>Not so many years ago, but just about the time when
she was in the zenith of her career, she met just the
same kind of a man she is talking with now. She had
had a great deal of experience with old men and she
took advantage of all she knew to make him like her.</p>

<p>She succeeded—hence this story.</p>

<p>The old fellow was all right, and he knew what was
necessary under the circumstances, and he made good
with characteristic rapidity. The first thing he did
was to buy her a handsome brownstone house on a
quiet side street, fill it full of handsome furniture, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
then he blew himself in for a neat little brougham and
pair for theatre use.</p>

<p>So far, so good, and the play went merrily on.</p>

<p>And now comes a spectacle, or a melodrama, or even
a farce, if you like.</p>

<p>He wasn’t her constant companion, because he was
clever enough to realize that if she saw too much of
him it might be fatal to his chances, so he timed his
visits with careful exactitude, and incidentally showered
her with gifts—which, after all, is one of the
direct roads to a woman’s heart.</p>

<p>But he made the fatal mistake one day of introducing
to her one of his old friends, and from that moment
there began a fierce rivalry between them for the
smiles of the auburn-haired actress; it was a duel with
a lock of hair as a reward; a combat with a smile for
the victor, and they both went to work with a will
and to the exclusion of every other object in life.</p>

<p>When one bought her a magnificent solitaire, she
showed it to the other and he promptly laid a tiara at
her feet, and it was unquestionably the greatest battle
of senile old idiots that ever raged.</p>

<p>Separately they took to waylaying her on the street
from her house to the theatre, and back again, and one
even went so far as to buy a magnificent yacht, equip
it for a long cruise, and attempt to kidnap her. But
that plan failed, and it was just as well that it did, because
the man who does eccentric stunts of that character
is apt to find himself in hot water sooner or later,
and in any event reap a whirlwind of scorn from the
lady in the case.</p>

<p>Finally, the climax came, as it was bound to come,
when they met at her house one Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
All this may be new to you, but you must remember
it was as common in club circles as the Spanish war,
and the results of the affair were watched for by thousands
of men whose names figure conspicuously in the
public prints.</p>

<p>They met and they quarreled, and when my lady
appeared on the scene these two beaux were on the
verge of punching each other in good old Queensbury
fashion.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, gentlemen, I beg that you will not
quarrel in <em>my</em> house.”</p>

<p>You will notice that she put the accent on the word
“my.”</p>

<p>At once there were criminations and recriminations,
but with that charm of manner which made her famous,
not only on the stage, but in the drawing room,
to say nothing of the cafe, she poured oil on the
troubled waters.</p>

<p>“I do not really know what your differences are
about, but if you will allow me, I would like to suggest
that you settle them in some amicable way. Here are
dice and a cup, why not play for it?”</p>

<p>They looked at each other for a moment, and then
one said:</p>

<p>“Yes, we will do it, madame, just the thing. Here, I
will make the first throw,” and out upon the shining
surface of the golden table rolled the three ivory cubes.</p>

<p>They fought it out while she looked on languidly,
and at last when it had been decided, the winner arose
exultingly and shouted:</p>

<p>“I have won.”</p>

<p>“Won what?” she queried, curiously.</p>

<p>“Won what? Why, won you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
“Won me?” and she placed her taper finger on her
breast. “Why, how very charming that is. I ought to
congratulate you, I suppose, and I shall certainly let
you know when I come back—if you are still alive.”</p>

<p>“You’re not going away?” he faltered. “When?”</p>

<p>“I sail to-morrow morning at eight o’clock; I go
aboard this afternoon. I am going to Europe for a
good long rest; mother says I need it, and so we are
going together. Good afternoon. Let me congratulate
you on being so lucky, and to win me, too. Why,
it’s like a romance. How splendidly that would stage.”</p>

<p>Down the street the two old fellows walked, one
slightly in advance of the other. At the corner the
one who was ahead, hesitated a moment, then turned
and waited for the other to come up.</p>

<p>“Tom,” he said. “I don’t know what you think, but
I am of the opinion that we are a pair of damned old
fools who ought to know better. Let’s go and have a
drink.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman who is pouring out that wine for
her now would perhaps like to hear that story in all its
wealth of detail, but even if he knew it might make
no difference.</p>

<p>Of all the thousands of people who go to restaurants
there are only a few who do not go for the sole purpose
of eating. We have been here an hour and have
looked over but two tables, and the story is not half
told.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_27">A VOICE IN THE SLUMS</h2>
</div>

<p>This is one of the “places” of New York.</p>

<p>It is not worth looking at in the daylight, because
there is nothing to see.</p>

<p>It is gray, dull, dreary and desolate—too dismal to be
considered for even a moment.</p>

<p>About it all there is not one thing that is attractive.</p>

<p>It is downtown and on the East Side, and that is
enough to tell the story.</p>

<p>If you have never been downtown on the East Side
of this big city, go and take a look some time, it is
worth it, and you may see some things there—as I have—that
will interest you.</p>

<p>At night you wouldn’t recognize this place because
of the softening and concealing effect of the electric
lights.</p>

<p>Besides the lights there is music, and in addition to
that there are women—what kind of women you can
guess, but the fact remains that they are still women,
and even their presence helps to brighten up this spot
of the slums.</p>

<p>Toughs of the street straggle in singly and by twos,
glancing warily about for prey, or in search of girls to
whom they are attached. The type is familiar enough
in every city. Square-jawed, low-browed, with shifting
eyes and an aggressive manner; dressing well when
the money comes easy, and not so well when hard
times arrive; living by their wits, which at the best is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
precarious, relying for the necessities of life upon a
girl; spending a certain portion of time in jail, unless,
as it often happens, they are too cowardly to rob a
man, but not too cowardly to take from a woman.</p>

<div id="illo_28" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img src="images/i_260.jpg" width="438" height="629" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">She figured once at a masked ball that was raided by the police</div></div>

<p>Sightseers drift in, too, from everywhere, look
curiously about, as if expecting some remarkable and
extraordinary occurrence at any moment, and failing
in that, they take chairs at the nearest table, and give
meek orders to the aggressive waiter for liquors which
they seem afraid to drink.</p>

<p>At stated intervals someone sings a song, and between
times the music plays a waltz for those who
care to dance on the bit of polished floor reserved for
that purpose.</p>

<p>The very dregs of high life.</p>

<p>It is the lees of the wine.</p>

<p>Just a few years ago—so short a time that it seems
almost like yesterday—a young woman was singing
in light operas and doing occasional turns in vaudeville.
If I were to tell you her name now it would
have as familiar a sound to you as the name of any
other popular performer.</p>

<p>One of her distinguishing characteristics was her
voice, which had a remarkable and extraordinary
range.</p>

<p>And how she could use it.</p>

<p>She was absolute master of it, and there was no
doubt about her success, nor her future, either, barring
accidents, of course.</p>

<p>Besides that she was good to look at. She was of a
distinctive style of beauty, and she had a fetching way
with her which spelled magnetism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
Magnetism, between you and me, means success on
the stage—or anywhere else, for that matter. Take the
best actor or actress in the world, one who is perfect in
lines, diction and stage business; who is absolute master
of the art of stage craft, and rob them of magnetism,
and I will show you a failure.</p>

<p>So, you see, this young woman was well equipped
for the business she was in, and there is the picture.</p>

<p>Nicely gowned, looking and acting like a thoroughbred,
she had a big following of admirers, and there
didn’t seem to be anything on earth within reason that
she wanted she couldn’t have.</p>

<p>The limit of her vices was a few mild drinking bouts
with the boys and the occasional smoking of a cigarette,
even though there was a possibility that in the
years to come the tobacco would destroy the finer tones
of her voice.</p>

<p>The moral end of the business was her own affair,
and consequently will not be touched on.</p>

<p>Now look.</p>

<p>See that pallid woman?</p>

<p>The one who has just come in. She is talking to a
waiter now. Her thin face is seamed with lines, and
the light of youth, of life and of enthusiasm has gone
out of her eyes.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t think she was once a beautiful girl
with a wonderful voice, would you?</p>

<p>“I had the yin-yin so bad,” she is saying, “that I had
to go in and hit two pills before I came out. Now
I’m good till the lights go out.”</p>

<p>One night, after the show, she went with a party on
a slumming tour through Chinatown. They were out
to have a good time and nothing more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
In one of the resorts in which they stopped was a
good-looking young bartender who caught her fancy.
He was all right in a way, but she outclassed him about
twenty to one, but there is no telling what a woman is
going to do, or upon whom she is going to bestow her
favors, any more than one can tell what the state of
the weather will be a month or two months from
now.</p>

<p>She thought she was in love with him—but she
wasn’t. She had only taken a fancy to him, which was
a different sort of a proposition, but she didn’t know it
at that time.</p>

<p>She went on singing just the same, but the time she
was out of the theatre she spent with him, and the
more money she earned the better he dressed.</p>

<p>She dipped a little deeper into the different vices,
until at last she went up against the king of them all—opium.</p>

<p>With all of her drinking and cigarette smoking she
was still able to hold her own and keep her voice in
some kind of shape, and many a rare old song has she
trilled in some cheap dive, and made the old-timers
straighten up in their seats and tell her she was all
right. Previous to that she had figured in only one
escapade and that was when she was caught in a raid
at a masked ball which was so off-color and made up of
many desperate characters—men and women—that it
took a platoon of police with drawn clubs to bring the
affair to a sudden end.</p>

<p>They will never forget the night when she went
down to the “Drum” in James street, and after setting
up the drinks for the crowd, stood in the centre of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
grimy floor and without a note of accompanying music
sang Annie Laurie.</p>

<p>At the end of the first verse, a drunk crept on his
hands and knees from a dark corner where he had
been lying, and staggering to his feet, looked at her
dully with bloodshot eyes, and then cursed her so violently
that she instinctively shrank back for a moment.</p>

<p>But she had been drinking, too, and was equal to the
emergency.</p>

<p>“Shut up,” she retorted. “I’m going to sing the
whole damned song or break a rib trying,” and with
that she started on the second verse.</p>

<p>Sitting on a chair, holding his head in his hands, the
man began to sob and cry as only a man whose heart
is aching can, and then, as if he could stand it no longer,
he rushed madly from the place while she laughed.</p>

<p>“I can make them all quit if they will stay long
enough.”</p>

<p>Almost a year later that same man, but dressed and
washed and respectable, came downtown one night,
and went through all the places upon whose floors he
had fallen and slept many a night, looking for the girl
who had sung that song.</p>

<p>He found her at three o’clock in the morning on the
Bowery.</p>

<p>She was sitting at a table in McGurk’s with two men
with whom she had been drinking cheap whiskey for
hours.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said the man, “but are you the
young woman who sang a song in a place on James
street about a year ago—Annie Laurie it was?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
“I may have, old pal, I’ve sung a lot of songs in my
day.”</p>

<p>“Well, you will probably be glad to know that that
song was the turning point in my life, and I am now a
reformed man. I feel that I owe it to you, and I want
to give you some little memento that you can keep.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he pulled a package out of his pocket
and handed it to her. With unsteady fingers she unwrapped
it and when she had opened the case she saw
a gold watch upon which was engraved:</p>

<p>
<i>To the singer who saved my life.</i>
</p>

<p>“You’re a good old sport, all right, let’s have a drink
on it.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” he said, hurriedly. “I must be going
now, but I want to tell you that you have a great
gift which you are throwing away.”</p>

<p>“So long, old pal, live while you can, for you’ll be a
long time dead,” she said, and he was gone.</p>

<p>She looked at the watch curiously for a moment,
and then called one of the waiters.</p>

<p>“Ha, Jimmy, here’s a swell watch. Ask the old man
how much he will give me for it—it looks to be worth
about fifty.”</p>

<p>The waiter returned in a few minutes and said:</p>

<p>“He says he’ll give you ten.”</p>

<p>“All right, he’s on, get the coin.”</p>

<p>She stayed until she had spent the money, and then
she went reeling home.</p>

<p>True? Of course it’s true, every word of it.</p>

<p>But she’s not drinking so hard now, opium is her
god, and she spends most of her time with her pipe
and her lamp. Her downward course has been a very
rapid one, and her name has almost been forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
The man at the next table is whispering to his
friends:</p>

<p>“She was the greatest singer I ever heard, and many
a time I’ve gone to the same show three times in one
week just to hear her, and when a woman’s voice gets
me like that you can bet it’s got to be good.”</p>

<p>“Get her to sing now; I’d like to hear her.”</p>

<p>“Sing now? Why, she couldn’t sound a note if her
life depended on it. She’s got all she can do to talk
plain. She looks like a piece of leather, doesn’t she?
Yet she made the prettiest picture on the stage I ever
saw.”</p>

<p>Her voice interrupted here.</p>

<p>It was harsh and strident in tone—there was little of
the woman in it.</p>

<p>“Well, if you won’t buy me a drink I’ll buy one for
myself; give me a whiskey, Jack, and don’t be all
night about it, either.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you get that Chinky of yours to buy you
a drink?” remarks some one from the other side of
the room.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you mind your own business? He’d
buy me all the drinks I wanted if I would ask him, and
that’s more than you would do. If anybody asks you
just tell them that the Chinks are all right, see, and
don’t be so new.”</p>

<p>“Cut that out, you fresh guy over there, cut it out.”</p>

<p>Here’s a champion for her; there are a few left who
are still under her spell, or who, remembering what
she once was and knowing her in her palmy days, stick
for old time’s sake.</p>

<p>“Have a drink on me, old pal, and go as far as you
like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
She comes back with a laugh; and if you look closely—if
you have those kind of eyes that can see things
below the surface, so to speak—you will see that she
doesn’t really belong here, and never did. That she is
here because of some unfortunate series of circumstances
over which, perhaps, she had no control. You
will see something in her manner that distinguishes
her from the rest of the women, even those who are
better looking and better dressed. It is that intangible,
indefinite something which means blood, or previous
environment. It cannot be put on and taken off like a
garment, and when once there it is there to stay.</p>

<p>That makes the wreck all the more pitiable, and with
the same eyes through which you have just looked you
will see the finish.</p>

<p>It isn’t pleasant to look at, and now, while the music
is playing for the waltz, and the couples are getting on
the floor to go through that interminable routine of
steps called dancing, while the painted women are
laughing, and the men are calling them pet—or other—names,
we will go out of this room to where we can
breathe a fresher air and see the stars.</p>

<p>I’m not sentimental, but there are some things I
don’t like to see, besides, I knew the girl when she was
at her best, and I have heard her sing when she
brought the house down with applause.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_28">A GIRL OF THE NIGHT</h2>
</div>

<p>The band on the platform at the end of the big hall
was booming out the popular melodies of the day for
dear life and the piercing notes produced by the
leather-lunged piccolo player were heard as far as the
street.</p>

<p>“That guy up there has me deaf with that flute he’s
blowing,” remarked Big Lizzie, “and while I don’t
wish him any harm yet I hope he chokes.”</p>

<p>“That knocks this place,” remarked her pal. “Why,
I had a John in here the other day and he was wanting
to buy me a new dress, and I thought he was wanting
to know where I lived, and I was writing my name
and number down on a piece of paper and he got disgusted
and went away. It drives ’em out, if you want
to know what I think.”</p>

<p>But it was once a famous old place when Fourteenth
street was really good, and the casual visitor to New
York who didn’t drop in for an hour or so missed
something.</p>

<p>It was one of the sights, and the great mechanical
organ invented and built by a straight-laced Methodist
is there still, although he has long ago ceased calling
the attention of his friends to the fact. Its tunes to-day
are sandwiched in with those of the band, and in
the interval the trombone player gets a chance to recover
his breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
Morning, noon and night men and women wander
in, sit at the little round tables, drink queer decoctions
made of liquor strong enough to eat into Harveyized
steel, and then go forth to tear up the town. The police
pass it by as though it were nothing more serious than
an ice cream parlor or a peanut emporium, while the
tide of upholstered and hand-painted mademoiselles
sweep in on the flood and drift out on the ebb with
business written in every line of their faces.</p>

<p>Their paths radiate like the sticks of a fan from this
rendezvous of the social evil, and in their movements
they show nearly all the characteristics of the honey-gathering
bee.</p>

<p>The engaging and winsome smile of a girl not yet
out of her teens had caught the eye of the man in this
story, and against his will he had allowed her to lead
him into this place where mirth was nothing more nor
less than a mask behind which a skeleton face grinned,
and where neither laughter nor anything else was sincere.
Her black eyes had not yet taken on that hardness
which the years to come would surely add to them,
and her ways were to a certain extent ingenuous. Besides,
she was distinctly pretty with her Yiddish style
of beauty, which was unfortunately of the kind which
matures at sixteen and is old at twenty-five. Either
teaching or a subtle instinct had caused her to discard
the gorgeous plumes and brilliant colors which had
marked her debut on the street less than a year before,
and in consequence she might have passed for anything
but what she was.</p>

<p>She had been on the stage once on a tour, but got a
rough deal and quit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
He outclassed her by a hundred to one, and his
source was as high as hers was low. There was no
tinge of peasantry in his veins, but good successful
American stock traceable back for five or six generations
without a blot upon escutcheon—which, by the
way, is rather rare in these days, consequently it’s
worth boasting about. Lured into the maelstrom of
music, he found himself at one of the tables with the
girl beside him, still smiling.</p>

<p>Liquor has different effects on different men; it
turns the mild man into a savage and makes a careful
one reckless in the extreme. In this particular case
caution went to the four winds and sympathy—which
is apt to be dangerous at times—took its place. But
let youth and inexperience excuse him.</p>

<p>“You haven’t told me your name,” he said. “What
is it?”</p>

<p>“Brown,” she answered, “Jennie Brown.”</p>

<p>“I mean your right name.”</p>

<p>“Well, Jennie is my right name—I took the other
one after I came out of the hospital. Some day, maybe,
I’ll get married and then I’ll change it again, but not
before.”</p>

<p>“What did you go to the hospital for—were you ill
and did you have no one to take care of you?”</p>

<p>“Ill? You mean sick? No, I wasn’t sick; I was
stabbed, and I got it good, too. I was cut from here to
here,” and her right forefinger described across the
front of her dress a line that went from her shoulder
to the center of her breast bone. “At first I thought I
was going to croak because I lost a lot of blood, but I’m
pretty strong and I came out all right. You see, it was
this way: A guy I knew got stuck on me and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
couldn’t shake him, and he followed me around like
a shadow. I didn’t like him because he wasn’t in
my class, and besides he had another girl and I never
took a girl’s fellow away in my life. If they split up
then that’s different, but as long as they’re together
I keep out of it. Every time I’d talk to anybody or
go anywhere he’d be there. One night he followed
me and a fellow I had that wanted to buy wine into
Sharkey’s and when he tried to start a fight with my
friend one of the waiters threw him out. Of course that
made him sore, and he said that he’d get even. He
did, all right, for one night as I was going upstairs he
was in the top hall waiting for me, and the first thing
I knew he had the knife into me.</p>

<p>“‘If you won’t have me, take this,’ he said, and then
I felt an awful pain and when I put my hand up the
blood was coming through my dress.</p>

<p>“‘You killed me, Jimmy,’ I said, ‘and I never done
anything to you.’ But there wasn’t any answer to
that, for he was running down the stairs as fast as he
could.</p>

<p>“I was afraid to go up to my room all alone with the
blood running out all over me so I went down to the
street to look for my pal, Annie. You don’t know her
but she’s all right. It was two o’clock in the morning
and there was no one around so I thought I’d walk
over to Third avenue and see if I could find any of the
girls there and get help. There was an electric light
up on the corner and I hadn’t taken more than a few
steps before it began to move up and down and I got
afraid and began to run. When I got up to the avenue
all the lights were going up and down as if they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
crazy and a man on the other side of the street looked
as if he was upside down.</p>

<p>“Then I began to get frightened and I thought to
myself that I’d sit down on a doorstep for a minute
till I got over that queer feeling and that maybe Annie
would come along. So I picked the first one I saw and
flopped down. When I looked up it made me dizzy
and so I looked down at the stone, and as I leaned over
I watched the little red drops falling, one after the
other, and always hitting the same spot, and then they
began to spread out and the pool almost reached the
sole of my shoe. I was wondering how long it would
take before my foot got wet from it, and where it all
came from, anyhow. It all seemed very funny to me;
then I felt tired and shut my eyes.</p>

<p>“The next thing I knew I was in bed and there was a
nurse there. A cop was there, too, and when I looked
at him he says, ‘Ha, nurse, she’s out of it.’</p>

<p>“‘What place is this?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“‘You’re in Bellevue Hospital,’ he said, and he was
right. I had been there two days before I knew it.
What do you think of that?”</p>

<p>“You were unconscious,” remarked the young man.</p>

<p>“Sure I was unconscious,” she responded, “and they
asked me all kinds of questions, who did it and all that,
and——”</p>

<p>“And did you tell them who it was that stabbed
you?”</p>

<p>“Did I tell them? Nix; not on your life. I never
rapped on anybody and I wasn’t going to rap on him,
for it wouldn’t do me any good and it wouldn’t take
that stab away, would it? I thought I’d get square myself
some day when I got out of the hospital and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
strong again. That’s the only way. Him going up the
river for a couple of years wouldn’t have done me any
good, and maybe he’d have croaked me when he came
out. What’s the good of taking chances? So I hocked
all my rings and other stuff, and got togged up when I
came out. I’ll get them all out in a month, maybe before.
I got one now; see,” and she held up a finger on
which was a very big turquoise, surrounded by very
small diamonds. “I’ll get them one at a time, and
then if I ever get up against it again I’ve got them to
fall back on. It’s just as good as money, only the interest
is awful. Now if I only had a good friend who
would——”</p>

<p>“Want the waiter?” broke in a hoarse voice like the
croak of a mammoth raven.</p>

<p>“Give me a claret lemonade, Harry.”</p>

<p>“And what’ll the gent have?”</p>

<p>“A Martini cocktail.”</p>

<p>“Right you are.”</p>

<p>“As I was saying, if I only had a friend who would
be on the level I’d be square with him, too. I ain’t got
no pals, only Annie, and she’s been pretty good to me.
Say, you ain’t married, are you?”</p>

<p>“No, not yet”; he laughed nervously as he said it.
“I don’t believe in fellows getting married until they’re
twenty-five, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I.”</p>

<p>He noticed that her teeth were very white and even,
and that her eyebrows and hair were jet black. The
color on her cheeks had been put there with a skilled
hand, and so deftly done that it passed for the real
thing—in nature, not in art. Her hands were shapely,
her nails manicured carefully and she had a trim figure.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
It was all stock in trade, but he wasn’t figuring
it that way. Half a dozen of the kind of drinks they
had given him had torn down the barrier, so far as he
was concerned, that had been raised by society between
it and the Scarlet Woman, and the pathos of her
story had set him thinking and had roused all of his
sympathies. She had played her part with all of the
subtleness of the finished actress and had told her story
with such simplicity and naivette that many an older
man would have been deceived by the recital. She was
working up to the climax as carefully and cautiously
as the hunter works up into the wind after the unsuspecting
deer, or the soft-footed cat ambushes the bird
singing in the hedge. The emotional breed of her race
helped to make her realistic, and her vivacity was contagious.
Put her on the stage and she would be a success
with proper training.</p>

<p>“If,” she laid her hand caressingly on the sleeve of
his coat, “if I could find someone who would get my
rings out and give me a chance I would be willing to do
anything for him. I don’t like this life, always hustling,
chased by the police and treated like a thief. But
once in it’s hard to get out, for no one wants to give
you a chance.”</p>

<p>He was looking over her head and watching the
man with the cornet rubbing up the brass with his
handkerchief.</p>

<p>“You are not listening to me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am; I heard every word you said. How
much would it cost to get your jewels out?”</p>

<p>“Only $125. It might not be much for you, but it’s
a lot for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
Here was the climax, so far as her story was concerned.
She could have repeated those three figures
long before, but she wasn’t ready. She was waiting for
the psychological moment and it had arrived. The
picture was made and the hand was ready.</p>

<p>And now your attention is respectfully called to
Fate, the intruder; the upsetter of carefully laid plans;
the wrecker; sometimes the promoter, because it does
as many things for good as it does for bad. In this
case, however, it was good and bad, according to the
viewpoint.</p>

<p>“If you wouldn’t mind I’ll get them out for you.
Let’s go now,” he said.</p>

<p>She leaned back in her chair and smiled at him—a
smile of happiness and success; the smile of a child
when it gets its first Christmas doll; and then she drew
a deep breath. Still smiling, her eyes half closed, she
looked at him through the narrow slits and contemplated
the possibilities of the future. There was no
hurry and she could afford to wait, for she had won
out.</p>

<p>A woman, coarse of feature and with fright depicted
on her face, came hurrying in. She saw the girl at
one end of the room and ran to her.</p>

<p>“Jennie, for God’s sake, come quick; your Billy’s
just been pinched on the corner.”</p>

<p>“Billy pinched; what for?” The jubilation in her
black eyes turned to terror.</p>

<p>“For swiping a bloke’s leather. They got it on him;
hurry up.”</p>

<p>The boy stared wide-eyed at them for a moment,
then pushing his chair back he arose unsteadily to his
feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
“Seventy-five cents for the drinks.”</p>

<p>It was the waiter’s voice.</p>

<p>He fumbled in his pocket, brought forth a handful of
change, deposited it in the outstretched palm, and began
to weave his way among the tables toward the
door in the wake of the hurrying women.</p>

<p>“He’s a swell kid, all right,” remarked the waiter,
as he counted the $3.25 in change, “and I hope he
comes back.”</p>

<h2 id="hdr_29">AFTER THE WEDDING BELLS</h2>
</div>

<p>There was a big crowd on the ferryboat from Jersey
when she bumped her nose into the pier at New
York that morning, but when the gates were thrown
open there wasn’t the usual scurry and rush to land
that marked the morning arrival. At the front, hugging
the rail on the woman’s side was a nice little
blonde dressed all in white, even down to her shoes and
stockings, and with a complexion of the kind known as
peachy, if you have any idea what that is. Fastened
to her with a strong arm hold was a fellow of about
twenty-three—years, not skiddoo, you understand—and
he was togged out like a hot sport after a winning
fight, or one who had picked the 20 to 1 shot
at Sheepshead for the first time in his life. Top hat,
frock coat, white vest, patent leather shoes, pearl tie
and gray gloves completed the picture, and it was the
surest case of orange blossoms and wedding cake that
ever happened.</p>

<p>That was what held the crowd and made a few of
them whistle what sounded very much like that old
familiar tune of “Here Comes the Bride.”</p>

<p>Arm in arm, entirely oblivious of anything in the
world except themselves and their own happiness, the
couple marched off the boat, heads up in the air and
trailed by the grinning bunch, and if ever a case of
love’s young dream went around on legs this was
surely it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
They knew as much about New York as a Shrewsbury
River clam knows about cigarettes, and it didn’t
require the services of a head-grabber or a hand-holder
to know that they were hunting a honeymoon hostelry.</p>

<p>They had come from the fertile fields of Freehold to
the land where there are real bathtubs with hot and
cold water, and where a chunk of plain calf is soused
with gravy, called fricandeau of veal, and charged for
at the rate of a dollar a portion.</p>

<p>What was money made for except to spend, especially
on occasions of this kind? You’re young but
once, and then a little makes you feel like a millionaire
and you get value received and five times over for
every dollar you peel off the roll. But when Time, who
is the most wonderful artist in the world, does a few
stunts, makes brown hair turn gray and deftly paints
in the wrinkles, then the joy of spending goes and
pleasure becomes as soggy as a wet sponge. Years are
the frosts which kill the flowers of hope and ambition,
and there are thousands of men who would give millions
of dollars if they could but stand off, if only for
a brief while, the gray-haired patriarch with the scythe.</p>

<p>Just think of the sight of a young bride and groom
holding in leash, as it were, a couple of hundred business
men who were as anxious to get on the job of
making money as a dog is to get a bone, and all of
these hard-headed fellows smiling as if each one of
them were in the same position as the young fellow
who was fast to her arm.</p>

<p>Up the street to Broadway, where they turned
north, and then they were lost to all but two men, and
these two were trailing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
Begins to sound like one of Old Sleuth’s detective
stories, doesn’t it? Where the villains are always on
the job and always being foiled. Where it is either a
case of murder the child and get the papers or kidnap
the girl and marry her so as to get the old man’s fortune.
Doesn’t that take you back a few years when
you used to have those yellow-covered books in your
inside pocket and believe every word you read, or are
you so unfortunate as to have never lived the life of
a real boy, with all its castle building and romancing?
You know there are men in this world who still dream
of those days, and it doesn’t do them any harm, either.</p>

<p>The two men who were brought into this story a
moment ago are still in the game, but they are neither
burglars nor kidnappers. They are simply a pair of
good fellows with enough money on the side to get
anything within reason, and a belief that there are
happy days and good people in this world if you only
take the trouble to look for them.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet,” said one, “that that kid hasn’t more than
a hundred in his clothes, and that he feels as if the
world was his to do with as he likes.”</p>

<p>“The world is his if he has as much as a hundred,”
returned the other. “That will give him the time of
his life for three weeks, and he wouldn’t go back
broke, either, unless his home is in London, which
it isn’t.”</p>

<p>“She’s a nice-looking girl all right, and from the
way they’re heading I should say it would be Niagara
for theirs.”</p>

<p>“Niagara nothing,” retorted his friend, “that is a
spot that belongs to the past. Our mothers and fathers
made it fashionable, but the present generation takes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
to big cities as naturally as a duck takes to water, for
they want the busy life and the theatres. The billing
and cooing of the newly wed is all done under cover
now and they mix with the crowd. You’ll find them
taking in the big cafes along The Line getting a good
look at things they never expect to see again, and these
are the things they will be talking about twenty or
thirty years from now. Make a picture of that couple
ahead there in 1926, for instance. He’ll be telling his
friends about this day, and the night they went to see
Joe Weber, and he’ll tell how the buildings first impressed
him, and then she’ll butt in with:</p>

<p>“‘Say, Henry, what was the name of the restaurant
in New York we went to after we saw that funny
show—you know, the place where we had that lobster
a la Newburg?’</p>

<p>“As long as she lives she’ll talk about lobster a la
Newburg because it sounds different, you see, and
that’s the woman of it.</p>

<p>“Then Henry will stroke his whiskers and take his
corncob pipe out of his mouth and say, as if he had
known the place all his life, ‘Why, that was Shanley’s.’”</p>

<p>“Cut it out, for you’re talking like one of Denman
Thompson’s home-made rural drammers,” put in his
friend, as he pulled out his cigar case. “You’re always
looking for the unusual and the sentimental, so I’ll
make you a proposition. Let’s get next to this pair of
turtle doves and give them the send-off of their lives.
We’ll start off with a lunch, then a matinee, after that
dinner, from there to a show and then a windup in a
blaze of glory with wine and all the trimmings of a
wedding feast. You’ve nothing to do, neither have I,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
and maybe if we do the thing up right she’ll name it—if
it is a boy—after one of us or both of us, just think
of that. There’s fame for you.”</p>

<p>That is how it happened that an hour later a newly-married
young couple, under the escort of two young
men who were pretty well known around town, were
lunching at the Waldorf just as if they had known
each other for years.</p>

<p>“You see,” one of the hosts was explaining, “we had
an invitation to a wedding out of town to-day and we
missed the train. We felt as if we wanted to entertain
some one in honor of the event and we thought we
would ask you. We want you to be our guests from
now until 1 o’clock to-morrow morning——”</p>

<p>The young husband glanced uneasily at his wife and
she smiled back reassuringly.</p>

<p>The woman, with that unerring female instinct
which is born with all females of the human tribe, understood
the situation at a glance and was ready for
the lark. Besides, both hosts were good looking and
well dressed and her vanity was touched. She was
young enough to be natural and old enough to be appreciative.
Besides, there were a few healthy drops of
sporting blood in her veins, and that tells a good part
of the story.</p>

<p>There are cases where details are uninteresting, and
while the time from luncheon to near the hour of midnight
seemed to the honeymooners one wild carouse
yet it was really nothing to those who are familiar with
the ways of the world. They had sampled everything
within reason from soda to hock, and the happy Freehold
boy with the silk lid was willing to walk on his
hands if anyone had dared him. He had told everyone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
he met all he knew and all he ever expected to
know. As for the little lady who had been toasted
many times as the “blushing bride,” she had suddenly
developed sporting proclivities of a rare character, and
she squeezed the hands of both of her hosts with equal
impartiality.</p>

<p>Confidentially it was rather a dangerous situation,
for if the bridegroom had been helped to a few more
drinks he wouldn’t have cared whether the place where
he was laid away was a bridal couch or the soft side of
a board. That was the state of affairs when, calling
each other by their first names, so friendly had they become,
that they all went up to the apartment of one of
the hosts for the wind-up banquet.</p>

<p>“How are you feeling, little sport, getting a head
yet?”</p>

<p>“I’m just right, and I’d like to have you for a
brother,” she retorted.</p>

<p>“Only a brother?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I should have said father.”</p>

<p>Which showed that she had a pretty wit, too, as well
as a head.</p>

<p>At the table the hosts had multiplied by two and so
there were six. The first flash of cocktails set the
groom’s head to buzzing a bit and his speech began to
be a trifle thick. At the sauterne he had a job to keep
his head up straight, and he had no sooner finished his
first glass of wine than he excused himself to get a
handkerchief. He dropped on a friendly couch in the
next room and promptly forgot that he was alive. His
wife was no such miserable failure, for she clinked
glasses with the rest of them and was entertained so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
well that it seemed as if she forgot she had ever been
married.</p>

<p>As the clock on the mantel struck two she was dancing
a hornpipe on that end of the table which had been
cleared by the soft-footed Japanese butler, and what
was more she was dancing it well, too. The four hosts
were applauding and drinking her health as the best
little thoroughbred they had ever met, and in each
brain there was a wish that she was anything but a
bride, for each of these men, from the oldest to the
youngest, was in love.</p>

<p>It was a most curious and remarkable state of affairs,
and there was a chance here for a break that might
spell ruin to someone. Then the patter of the little
feet on the tablecloth ceased and she stepped daintily
down to chair and floor. The man nearest helped her,
and as she alighted he leaned over and kissed her
squarely on the lips. The color in her cheeks was accentuated
just a trifle as he glanced suddenly around.</p>

<p>“Where’s my husband?” she asked.</p>

<p>“With his toes turned up on the couch in the next
room and dead to the world. If he was half the sport
and good fellow you are he’d be an ace. You ought to
have been born in New York, Chappie, for you belong
there.”</p>

<p>“I think I will go and see him, if you will excuse
me,” she said very demurely, and then she went out.</p>

<p>The four hosts drank and talked and smoked and all
the talk was of the bride, and it was all complimentary,
too. When an hour had passed the butler was sent to
see if she would return.</p>

<p>She came back all right, smiling, but there was a
change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
“I think we ought to go now, but I can’t get him up.
He’s not used to this sort of thing, you see, and I don’t
know what I’m going to do.”</p>

<p>“Why, stay right here, of course. We’re all going
now and Jim, the gorilla who owns the place, is going,
too. The shack is yours until you get ready to leave,
for you’re all right. How about that, Jim?”</p>

<p>“Just as you say—she owns it and us, too. Give
your orders to Saki there, and we’ll call and take dinner
with you every evening. We hope the boy will be
all right in the morning. Good-night.”</p>

<p>That’s all.</p>

<p>It seems as if there ought to be more, but there
really isn’t.</p>

<p>With one large high absinthe I could make a hair-raising
finish, but I have made up my mind to tell only
the truth for a change and give my imagination a
much needed rest, and this is a truthful story and it
happened just as it is put down here.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
